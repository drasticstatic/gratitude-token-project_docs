+# Fatherhood & Fellowship — Reflection and Preface

+

+It is autumn. The rain brings abundance. We gather firewood; we fill the Father's storehouse. This project is born from presence — from a parent who chooses, above all, to be with his children.

+

+The Ethereal Offering is an invitation: to harmonize code and covenant, technology and tenderness.
