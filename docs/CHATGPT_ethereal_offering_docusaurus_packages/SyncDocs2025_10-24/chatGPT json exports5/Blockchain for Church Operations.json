It is our sincere belief that the consumption of psilocybin-containing mushrooms is a communion which brings us closer to what is commonly called God, We understand this concept as pure consciousness, which permeates all being. This pure consciousness is, we believe the Ineffable Source of Creation and the origin of health and well-being. Psanctuary is a grounded, nature centered, non-dogmatic, non-hierarchical faith based organization.   \n\nOur faith in sacred mushrooms stems from pre-historical use by our ancestors and personal experiences of our modern members. It is our belief that psilocybin containing mushrooms are one of the greatest sacraments that Nature offers, raising our awareness so that we can access a direct connection to the Source of Life.   \n\nOur community consists of families and individuals from all walks of life and is open to individuals from any faith or background. We are an inclusive community recognizing only one race of humans and one life force that manifests in a multitude of forms and appearances. \n\n\n\n### Sunday   \nservices \n\nOpen to the public every Sunday at 10am Eastern.

It was recreational. But I very quickly came to understand this as a spiritual access point, if you will. It was probably two years after I was introduced to psilocybin when I got into cultivating culinary mushrooms. That became the biggest part of my mycological focus for probably about 10 years. I ended up starting a gourmet mushroom farm in Indiana. All the while, I was growing a little bit of psilocybin for myself for personal use and would give it away to friends, stuff like that.\n\nIn 2009, when I moved to a farm up in Indiana, I started growing psilocybin on a considerably larger scale. That\u2019s when my relationship with psilocybin really started to take off, not necessarily because I was growing so much but because living where I was, it afforded me the opportunity to work with other people. It gave me the opportunity to really start working dedicatedly, mainly with friends at first and then they started telling friends that they knew and it kind of turned into me just trying to support people who were trying to improve their lives through the use of psilocybin.\n\nIn 2011, I started to really realize or feel strongly that psilocybin was not being given the respect it was due. Ayahuasca was getting all this attention as this great healing psychedelic and I knew psilocybin had all that same potential. So in 2011, it just occurred to me, I had been traveling to Jamaica for about 10 years at that point, and psilocybin was unregulated there. So it just kind of started to occur to me that \u2018Hey, you can do this, you can help psilocybin get the respect that it deserves through retreats.\u2019 So in 2011, I decided I was going to do these retreats. I spent the whole year of 2012 taking pretty big doses myself. I did a regimen during 2012 of every new moon and full moon taking 5 to 10 grams by myself out in the wilderness on my property. By 2013, I started to feel confident and competent to lead people through these experiences en masse. In November 2013, I led the first beta MycoMeditations retreat down there [in Jamaica]. It was small, just five people. But it went pretty well.\n\nSo, I had the mushroom farm in the states, which wasn\u2019t making much money. I was selling psilocybin mushrooms to support the farm. And the [MycoMeditation] retreats in Jamaica, I never felt like I could be public about them because of the amount of psilocybin I was growing in the U.S. So I just kind of tried to get those going through a word of mouth kind thing\u00a0\u00a0all the while wanting to get out of black\u00a0market psilocybin mushrooms. It was never anything that I really wanted to do.\u00a0\n\nmagic mushroom church \n\nThen in 2015, someone reported me and I was arrested. It was actually someone that I did a mushroom session for. They got into some trouble and they pointed the finger at me. My wife and I were both arrested and put on house arrest for 8 weeks. They forced us to be separate since we were considered co-defendants. So we were separated for a good while there. Then after all that was resolved I ended up getting kicked off the farm because I was leasing it. So I lost my mushroom farm, moved back to Kentucky where I am from, and started trying to find a way to really get the retreats in Jamaica up and running.  \n\nIn February 2016, I had two guests that came down on retreat who ended up donating a total of $30,000 to me for salary so that I could quit my day job and focus solely on my retreats. That is really what allowed me to grow that project.\n\nAll along, I had understood psilocybin as a spiritual growth tool. Because of Michael Pollan\u2019s work [How to Change Your Mind] and the Johns Hopkins\u2019 research, everything was focused on psychology and depression and all that and my understanding back then and now still is that it\u2019s not just a neurochemical outcome. There is a deeper healing that occurs that allows us to really experience more fully what it means to be human. So I went on with MycoMeditations and ran those retreats until 2020 and then kind of decided it was time to go back to my roots really.\n\nThe retreats in Jamaica, I very much loved doing that work but I never felt like I was really fully able to express my understanding of psilocybin. This is 23 years now that I have been taking mushrooms regularly. So in 2020, I got out of the retreats in Jamaica to focus more on the spiritual side rather than the scientific side of psilocybin and we came back here, my wife and I, and the administrative assistant who was a part of Mycomeditations, she grew up as a church organizer so this just felt like the right thing for her, too. And it\u2019s how she understands psilocybin too: it\u2019s a sacrament, not just a medicine. I can\u2019t say that it\u2019s not a medicine but again, just my understanding and experience of it is that it\u2019s a medicine that\u2019s working on our spiritual, energetic body as much as it is working on our physical, neurochemical selves.\u201d\n\n> My understanding back then and now still is that it\u2019s not just a neurochemical outcome. There is a deeper healing that occurs that allows us to really experience more fully what it means to be human. \n> \n> Eric Osborne\n\n#### As you explore the magic mushroom church model, what image or message are you looking to put forward with Psanctuary?\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the things that we are really diligent about exemplifying. Conscientious, responsible, mature\u2026We really want to try to do our best to encourage only those types of organizations to follow suit because irresponsible leadership in psychedelics, whether it\u2019s a clinical setting or a religious setting, is detrimental to the entire movement.\u201d\n\n#### How do you operate a magic mushroom church without fear of law enforcement intervention?\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that we operate without fear of law enforcement getting involved but I would say that our establishment through a pretty solid team of attorneys helps us feel a whole lot more confident. We have at least one advisor who has been an advisor to the DEA who helps us understand storage requirements and transportation requirements and all that. We spent about six months with three different attorneys setting up all the bylaws, all the infrastructure. Basically, once you file as a religious organization and get your paperwork and you\u2019re recognized by the federal government as a religious organization, it\u2019s on you to follow the best practices and to ensure that you meet the guidelines.\u201d\n\n#### In a nutshell, what is the legal precedent or verbiage that allows Psanctuary and other magic mushroom churches to operate?\n\nIf the existence of a church hinges on the use of a single sacrament and the permission or allowance of that sacraments\u2019 use is the least obstructive means for the federal government to ensure the safety of those church members, then they have to keep their hands off of it.\u201d\n\n#### Do you know of any other magic mushroom church in the U.S. or abroad devoted only to psilocybin mushrooms as its sacrament?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know of anybody that is just working with psilocybin. I have seen several churches that are cannabis and psilocybin or psilocybin and ayahuasca, this or that, but I don\u2019t know of anybody that publicly or privately is just psilocybin other than us right now.\u201d\n\n#### I saw on your website that you have to apply to become a member of Psanctuary. What does that vetting process look like?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not extremely extensive but we want to know a general intention and a little bit about mental health. You don\u2019t have to take the mushrooms to be a member of our church. We have quite a few people who are just considering the possibility of working with the mushroom that have never yet and they just want to be part of the community to understand how it is being applied in this manner. But it is a pretty simple process: just a brief application to kind of give us an idea of where you are coming from and why you are coming to us.\u201d\n\n#### From what I understand, once you are a member you have the opportunity to consume magic mushrooms, what you call your \u201csacramental service,\u201d under the guidance of a Psanctuary-sanctioned cleric/moderator. What does that look like?\n\n\u201cAnytime we do a sacramental service, it is a three day event that includes four weeks of coaching, so two weeks of preparation and two weeks of integration afterwards. We offer up to an eight-week coaching program that is pretty involved. My background is in education. That is really what I have always considered myself in this world, is just educating people how to use the mushrooms for their own personal growth.\u201d\n\nOsborne then explained the three-day sacramental service as typically occurring on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. They only allow around five or six members to engage with the sacrament in a service. Members usually arrive on Friday afternoon, meet each other and prepare, commune with the mushrooms on Saturday under the guidance of the moderator and with one sitter for every two members ingesting the sacrament, and then have their weekly Sunday service on Sunday morning before leaving for their respective homes.\n\nAside from the \u201csacramental services,\u201d the church also hosts a weekly, 90-minute Zoom call every Sunday combining inspirational readings and aspects characteristic of an integration circle. \n\n \n\n#### How do you decide on the proper dosage for each member taking part in these sacramental services?\n\n\u201cI want to make sure that people are able to have a powerful enough experience that it is transformative but at the same time I want to make sure that things don\u2019t get too out of hand. One of the things that is an element of that is continuing to work with people who I have worked with over a long period of time, so knowing how individuals respond individually.\n\nFor those I\u2019m new to working with, I just take it a little slow and help them understand that even if they don\u2019t have a massive experience, they still are going to get an enormous amount of benefit out of it, especially with the coaching and if they are willing to put in the work to really explore what they came across. Personally, one of the realizations that I\u2019ve come to in the last several years is that bigger is not always better when it comes to working with the mushroom.\u201d\n\n#### You mentioned that coaching program and on your site, I see mention of \u201cMore than Integration.\u201d Tell me about More than Integration and your view of integration generally.\n\n\u201cMore than Integration (MTI) is basically considered an extension of the Psanctuary ministry and MTI is that coaching program that is a part of the sacramental services. So when people sign up for a weekend with us, that\u2019s actually what, aside from the lodging, accommodations, and food, that is what they are paying for: the coaching program.\n\nThat arose out of my experience in Jamaica because we had onsite integration and follow up integration afterwards but I never really felt like this kind of typical integration where you just kind of recall your experiences and try to understand what your experiences meant, I never really felt like that was enough. I still don\u2019t. I feel like what people really need is an ongoing community. I am still very much integrating my first experience when I was 19 years old.\n\nSo to put together an intentional community that provides support, provides tools, provides ongoing, continuing education opportunities for people to gain more insight into their experiences as they have additional openings of their heart and mind is really what the name is trying to imply. Psychedelic growth requires more than just this standard concept of integration. It really requires a lifestyle change, an immersion in a community that can support you for years if need be.\u201d\n\n \n\n## Try our Psychedelic Journeywork Course for FREE\n\nSneak Peak PJW Enrolment Form \n\n\u0394 \n\nFirst Name \n\nEmail \n\nGet the Free Class!\n\n#### What kind of people are members of Psanctuary? Where are they from? What\u2019s their background?\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got people from Norway coming in, we\u2019ve got people from Jamaica that I\u2019ve worked with down there, we\u2019ve got people from the UK already coming into this on the zoom calls. It\u2019s really exciting to just see this building as a community of support and shared perspective.\n\nI think there\u2019s a lot of people out there who are, while everybody respects the clinical and research models that are ongoing and all of that, but there are a whole lot of people out there that really look at this from a much more personal perspective. It\u2019s not just a medicine. This is not just a science-based experience. This is something we cannot put words to. This is a mystical experience and the science supports that the mystical experience, the mystical aspect of the psilocybin experience, is elemental to the healing that comes out of it.\u201d\n\n#### How old is Psanctuary? How has it been going thus far? \n\n\u201cWe are actually only 19 weeks into our organization\u2019s official start so considering we\u2019re only 19 weeks in, we\u2019ve already got 100+ members, I feel like we are doing pretty good. I am a pretty ambitious person though so I want some of these other projects in place ASAP. There\u2019s a whole lot more that we have planned but right now we are just trying to really lay a solid groundwork.\n\nThe Sunday services are excellent at building that community and spreading the community out. I am very hopeful that in time Psanctuary will have locations around the country, possibly in other countries, who knows? And the Sunday calls are a great way to get that ball rolling and build the little smaller communities here and there. It\u2019s hard for things to move as fast as I would like them to but when I actually take a step back and look at it, we\u2019re doing pretty good for where we are considering that there\u2019s only three of us that are really running the organization.\u201d\n\n> \"We trust the medicine. We trust the sacrament. We trust the primacy and intelligence of the mushroom and the best thing that we can do usually is to stay the f**k out of the way.\u201d \n> \n> Eric Osborne\n\n#### When I read your website, it sounds as though your approach is more akin to sitting than to guiding. Do you agree with that assertion?\n\n\u201cAbsolutely, 100%. We trust the medicine. We trust the sacrament. We trust the primacy and intelligence of the mushroom and the best thing that we can do usually is to stay the f**k out of the way.\u201d\n\n#### What does the religious model of operating a magic mushroom church allow for that the other models don\u2019t? Put another way, what are the unique opportunities or benefits the religious model offers that you don\u2019t see the other models possessing?\n\n\u201cPersonally, it allows me to feel more comfortable expressing my authentic relationship with the mushroom. This allows me to really from the start, as someone who has been working with mushrooms for 23 years, allows me from the first time I sit down with somebody, to talk with them in the most authentic way possible. That\u2019s the only aspect of inauthenticity that I ever felt I brought into the space in Jamaica. It just became apparent that I could no longer strictly work in what I consider still to be a pretty dry and even kind of egotistical manner.\n\nI love the science. Science is what got me into mushrooms. But it only goes so far. And I feel like both typical religion and typical science have this very egotistical \u2018we know the answer\u2019 kind of perspective and I call bullshit. We don\u2019t know. And that\u2019s the perspective that I always try to take from the beginning when I\u2019m working with somebody is that I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. I don\u2019t know. I am doing my best to try to put the pieces together just like you. I get new information all the time that maybe gives me a broader perspective. But the truth is we\u2019re never going to fully know what\u2019s going on with reality and the human experience while we are in this limited physical capacity.\u201d\n\n \n\n#### How do you make sure you reduce the potential for harm as much as possible?\n\n\u201cThere are two elements to assuring harm reduction outside of the dosing and setting and the mindset going into it. One is to stay out of the way of the mushroom. Once you start to interfere with someone\u2019s experience, and I don\u2019t think enough practitioners really understand this and I think particularly in the clinical setting it\u2019s not really understood well enough, but once you start to interfere or interject yourself into someone else\u2019s experience, you are introducing variables that can bring about outcomes that you are not ready to deal with.\n\nThe other crucial element that I truly believe is the most important aspect of harm reduction when you are working with people under the influence of psychedelics is your own personal level of experience. If people know that you are inauthentic, that you are insincere, that you are not there for them, but you are there to somehow boost your own ego or to try to play hero, that will be known. I have seen it cause serious upset and I have seen facilitators who put their intentions and their ego before the people that they are working with, or who came to the space with a lot of their own very dark stuff that they had not worked through. That will cause some real problems. If you have somebody who is on a large dose of psilocybin and they are freaking out, if you tell that they are going to be okay but you don\u2019t trust that they are going to be okay, they are going to know that and it is going to escalate the situation so much more rapidly.\n\nThe subtleties that go into this space, the subtleties that contribute to safety are not talked about enough. There\u2019s a lot of talk about eyeshades and music and methods of control but in my experience, my sincere belief is that the most effective safeguard that we can bring into this space is our own authenticity and our own ability to look at our shit, to have real tough experiences with the mushroom so that people know that they are working with someone who\u2026maybe I\u2019ve never experienced what you are experiencing per se, but I have died a thousand times on mushrooms, I\u2019ve had at least 500 doses of psilocybin myself and so many of those have been just excruciating. So people know when you look at them and you say to them \u2018I get it.\u2019 When they are in that state of high perception and real vulnerability, they know if you are telling the truth or if you are just bullshitting them and if you are bullshitting them it\u2019s going to set off so many alarms.\u201d\n\n \n\n## Try our Mushroom Cultivation Course   \nfor FREE\n\nSneak Peak PJW Enrolment Form \n\n\u0394 \n\nFirst Name \n\nEmail \n\nGet the Free Class!\n\n#### Personally, why do you engage in this work?\n\n\u201cI could say that it\u2019s about the healing of the individual but what I have really learned from working with the mushroom is that whenever one of us sets on a healing path, whenever one of us experiences some kind of exponential growth, we are not figuratively, we are literally doing that for the collective of humanity.\n\nI have worked with some very challenging situations and most of those people were just regular folks who had been building up a lifetime of unprocessed trauma. It just really is important to me that people know that they are supported, they know that we are here to be of service to them so that they can grow and be the best that they can be so when they go back to their homes and their communities, they can take that there and help their communities be better.\u201d\n\nI have seen processing take place that provided relief for people seemingly completely unassociated with the event. I know that it sounds flaky to a lot of people but I know that beyond a doubt that every time somebody eats mushrooms in a safe, cared for manner where healing is allowed to occur, that they are helping to heal every human being on this planet. We truly are one. That is not a metaphor.\u201d\n\n#### What does success look like to you and Psanctuary? What\u2019s Psanctuary look like in 5 years, ideally?\n\n\u201cSuccess looks like a growing community of compassion and authenticity. It\u2019s pretty simple. They [psilocybin mushrooms] are a tool for processing but as we process this kind of stagnant information, then we become more authentic and if there is anything that will really help to heal humanity, it\u2019s if we put down all these fucking masks, and all this bullshit baggage of \u2018I\u2019m this group\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m this person\u2019 and we just really get back to the basics that we are just humans and we don\u2019t even know what that is. Through that we can learn to love each other and love the moment a little bit more and the closer we get to that, that\u2019s what I call success. Success is not an end result. Success is an ongoing effort.\u201d\n\n#### Before we close, I want to hand you the mic. Is there any other message you want to offer?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important to advise caution. It can look a lot simpler than it is. I know there are a lot of people who are thinking \u2018Maybe I should start a church.\u2019 I\u2019m not saying that you shouldn\u2019t but I\u2019m not saying you should. People don\u2019t see the 23 years of experience that has gone into this thing right here right now and that is really important to consider because this is not a fucking play thing. I also just really want to make sure people are smart for their own safety and for the ongoing growth of this work so that more people can get access to the healing of these mushrooms.\u201d\n\nmagic mushroom church \n\n## about the author\n\nSam\u00a0is a writer, award-winning journalist and professional mycologist from the United States who arrived at the Fungi Academy one midsummer\u2019s day in 2019 and left six weeks later with lifelong friends and a passion for mushroom cultivation.\n\nIn the past year three years, he\u2019s built a laboratory and fruiting room in his home, cultivated and foraged over 20 species of gourmet and medicinal mushrooms, started a medicinal mushroom tincture business and returned to the Fungi Academy to teach his techniques to students.\n\n \n\n#### Responses\n\n##  \n\nYour email address will not be published.

The group has tokenized the \u201cOld Stone Church,\u201d a historic 11,457-square-foot building, to raise $2.5 million for its ownership. \n\nAdvertisement \n\n#### Related Content\n\n16 states betting on a U.S. Bitcoin Reserve\n\nCryptic posts drive stocks, and Bitcoin turns 16: Markets roundup\n\n#### Related Content\n\n16 states betting on a U.S. Bitcoin Reserve\n\nCryptic posts drive stocks, and Bitcoin turns 16: Markets roundup\n\nWhile this may sound new, as it will be the first church ever to be tokenized, it is not new for the blockchain world to tokenize real-world assets. In simple terms, the tokenization of funds is the process of converting real-world assets (RWAs) or funds into digital tokens using blockchain technology. Real-world assets encompass tangible assets like real estate, intellectual properties, art, currencies, commodities, equities, bonds, money markets, and more.\n\nAdvertisement \n\nPastor Blake Bush led the initiative, believing this innovative approach was divinely inspired. \n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI heard the Lord say, \u2018tokenize the building,\u2019\u201d Bush told Forbes. He further added that he had been \u201cpraying for this for years\u201d and that God had told him to \u201cgo get my house.\u201d\n\n## Why is the church tokenizing itself?\n\nBush\u2019s congregation and other church groups had been renting the Old Stone Church from its current owner, a local businessperson who also owns a car dealership. The building was purchased in 2022 for $2.2 million. Bush and the Colorado House of Prayer now plan to buy it for $2.5 million. To achieve this, Bush partnered with REtokens, a company specializing in the tokenization of real estate assets, to tokenize the building using the Polymesh blockchain.\n\nAdvertisement \n\nOne Hope of Colorado aims to pioneer a new model for community investment through real-world asset tokenization, selling shares to the community to raise funds. The goal is to secure enough capital to purchase the Old Stone Church within three years, preserving the historic building. In its initial phase, One Hope intends to raise $2.5 million from accredited investors within the first year. These investors will hold the tokens for a year before selling them on a secondary market, primarily to Colorado residents. \n\nGraeme Moore, Head of Tokenization at Polymesh Association, stated that real estate is undergoing a transformation through real-world asset tokenization.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOne Hope of Colorado, as the first-ever tokenized church, is a great example of unlocking liquidity and fostering collaborative ownership,\u201d he said in a press release.\n\nPastor Bush and his group have created \u201cStone Coin,\u201d a digital asset designed to raise funds for purchasing the Old Stone Church. As with any tokenization project, its success will rely on the level of positive token flow and market response.\n\n##  Sign up for the Daily Brief \n\nOur free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.", "snippet": "A church in Colorado plans to tokenize and run on the blockchain network in an effort to raise $2.5 million.

Few technologies have been as revolutionary as the internet, which, like any other major technological advancement, changes over time and develops through phases. We are now entering what many perceive as a new phase of the internet, often called web3. It has a common motto of \u201cread, write, own.\u201d In the first phase of the internet (web1), you could simply visit websites and read them. In the second phase (web2), you could also add your own content, such as posting pictures or writing reviews, but you didn\u2019t really own that content. The content you created was controlled by big companies such as Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and YouTube, which could censor or control what you posted. In this third phase (web3), proponents anticipate that you will be able to truly own what you create, allowing for an internet that is more democratic, private, and secure.\n\nWhat underlies this new era of digital ownership is blockchain technology. What is blockchain? It\u2019s really just a modern twist on the ancient practice of keeping records. Accounting began in ancient Mesopotamia, where the first accountants etched marks onto clay tablets, each line signifying a transaction. This sort of \u201csingle-entry\u201d bookkeeping held sway for centuries, until \u201cdouble-entry\u201d bookkeeping came along during the fifteenth-century Renaissance. Double-entry bookkeeping revolutionized accounting by instituting a dual-column system of debits and credits. This method of recording things twice brought accuracy, consistency, and reliability to accounting practices, and our banks still use a variation of this system today. Double-entry bookkeeping, however, still depends on humans and institutions, so it can be prone to data alteration, lack of transparency, human error, and fraud.\n\nBlockchain technology represents what seems to be a new method of keeping accounts, or bookkeeping. It introduces a third component to double-entry bookkeeping: a cryptographically secure digital receipt. Some have called blockchain \u201ctriple-entry\u201d bookkeeping. Transactions continue to be recorded twice, but an innovative third entry is now included in a shared public ledger and is given a unique, tamper-proof digital signature through automated computer code. A trusted third party, such as an accountant or institution, is no longer needed because the code automatically verifies the transactions. The ledger is immutable, so it can\u2019t be altered or deleted, thereby strengthening the transaction\u2019s integrity. Picture this as like a public bulletin board, where new notices can be added but existing ones cannot be altered or removed.\n\nFew technologies have been as revolutionary as the internet, which, like any other major technological advancement, changes over time and develops through phases.\n\nShare\n\nThe internet, as it exists now, consists primarily of many companies that keep accounts, or ledgers, of what we\u2019ve posted, what emails we\u2019ve sent or received, or what money we have in our bank accounts. These companies are often large corporations, such as Google, Facebook, X, Amazon, Apple, and Chase. We depend on these organizations\u2019 goodwill for access to our digital property. With blockchain technology, it\u2019s possible that in the future, internet users won\u2019t depend on any individual organization for access to and management of their property. Rather, what one owns on the internet will be immutably recorded on the blockchain, so no large corporation\u2014or anyone, for that matter\u2014will be able to take your digital property away from you. Many refer to this idea as decentralization, because blockchain decentralizes bookkeeping authority. This technology, therefore, has the potential to be truly revolutionary, overturning business models, changing corporations, and enabling new means of engagement on the internet that aren\u2019t so controlled by third parties.\n\nGiven this potential for change, how can Christians anticipate the future? What benefits and dangers might Christians need to consider in thinking about the future of the internet? Here are a few:\n\nFree Speech. The right to free speech is often regarded as the right upon which all other rights are built. It encompasses our ability to share the faith openly without fear of persecution or censorship. Web3 consists of decentralized applications that run on the blockchain. The use of these independent protocols could represent both a danger and an opportunity for free speech, since we will perhaps no longer be at the mercy of tech or media companies that determine what\u2019s appropriate to say. While it\u2019s possible that with no filter whatsoever, free speech will descend into a chaos of noise, at the same time, undiluted gospel proclamation could benefit.\n\nConstraint. The adoption of blockchain has the potential for harmful constraint, most notably the prospect of heightened regulation. For instance, nations can develop Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) to assert tighter control over their currencies. China\u2019s release of the digital yuan, which allows it to control, track, manipulate, and potentially block all transactions within its borders, is a case in point. Blockchain\u2019s versatility, however, also enables the removal of constraints on fund transfers and international communication, since digital currencies aren\u2019t inherently subject to central government control, with Bitcoin being one example. While this can inadvertently facilitate illegal activities, it also signifies that Christians\u2019 finances perhaps wouldn\u2019t be easily subjected to the whims of corporations with sinful agendas or oppressive political regimes. It could also make it easier to support missionaries and ministries in countries that are hostile to Christianity. Thus, blockchain could potentially offer Christians greater freedom, support, and encouragement, particularly in nations where gospel proclamation is suppressed.\n\nTrust. The recent boom in AI technologies poses a risk for truth and trust in many ways because they can often convincingly imitate people and institutions. To combat this, blockchain could serve as the standard of origin for original content. For example, bad actors might maliciously create or distort a piece of content, such as an article or a video, but content posted on a blockchain is unalterable and can prove where a work came from, almost like a watermark. Blockchain could provide a \u201cproof of truth\u201d or \u201cproof of originality\u201d through a ledger of public, immutable, and permanent content ownership and authenticity.\n\nPrivacy. Unlike the current internet, where YouTube, Facebook, PayPal, and other organizations often require you to share personal details before using their services, decentralized apps don\u2019t necessarily require users to provide personal data to access services and content or to make transactions. This enables anonymous usage. While anonymity can provide a cover for unhealthy and sinful engagement on the internet, Christians living under authoritarian regimes could leverage this anonymity to freely access gospel resources and donate to ministries without facing political persecution. By removing the need for identity verification, believers in oppressive contexts could engage in and contribute to global ministry efforts with minimized risk.\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nDistribution. What if we could distribute Christian content around the world instantly, without political repercussions, and practically for free? One of the most attractive features for Christian missions and education is the capability within these technologies for seamless mass distribution of content around the world. Through decentralized networks, content creators could perhaps directly reach global audiences, bypassing geographical and political limitations.\n\nConnection. Paul\u2019s exhortation to the Thessalonians to \u201cencourage one another and build one another up\u201d (1 Thess. 5:11) is an ever-standing call to strengthen our Christian communities. Web3 could help the church in its effort to gather and grow together. While God\u2019s people are called to gather physically in local churches primarily, there is also an opportunity to use technology to further the spread of the gospel and discipleship resources to Christians and churches worldwide. Christians, ministries, and churches do not currently own the platforms where Christian communities gather digitally, such as Facebook, X, Instagram, and YouTube. Because we don\u2019t own these platforms, our communities can be censored at any moment or taken away without notice. Through web3 ownership, communities could perhaps be freer and more autonomous.\n\nFor all its perceived complexity and novelty, the decentralized web offers the global church benefits worth considering, although dangers certainly lurk in the background. To consider web3 and its potential does not represent an endorsement of blindly adopting all its aspects; rather, it\u2019s a call to equip ourselves with knowledge of our times and of what the future could possibly hold, to apply our faith in discerning what aligns with our values, and to engage wisely with the world. As Christians, we draw comfort from knowing that God is ultimately in control, and we can find solace in the truth that Jesus is the supreme authority over all powers (Col. 2:9\u201310).\n\n##### what now?\n\nWe find ourselves on the cusp of a new digital age, one in which we are being presented with a remarkable opportunity to thoughtfully engage with these emerging developments\u2014much as our forefathers did in their times. Approaching this journey with proper wisdom and discernment, we should strive to carry the gospel to people where they are (1 Cor. 9:19\u201323), remembering how church history stands as a faithful proof that the people of God effectively harnessed technology for the furtherance of the good news of Christ and the strengthening of the global church.\n\nAt the outset of such a daunting task, let us not lose heart as we navigate the challenges. Dr.\u00a0Sinclair Ferguson was recently reflecting on Isaiah\u2019s prophecy in 49:6: \u201cI will make you as a light for the nations, that my salvation may reach to the end of the earth.\u201d He said: \u201cWe\u2019re living in days when this prophecy is being fulfilled [and] that\u2019s true despite all the doom and gloom we hear. .\u00a0.\u00a0. It\u2019s true we haven\u2019t yet fully fulfilled the Great Commission, and the church often fails, but God\u2019s promise to His Son that He will give Him the nations for His inheritance has not failed, and it will not fail.\u201d As we engage with this new digital landscape, let us do so with discernment, seeking to use technology for the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ and the expansion of His kingdom.\n\nJohn Cobb is vice president of strategic initiatives at Ligonier Ministries.  \n\n###### SHARE\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n  * Email\n\n#### Christian Ministry and the Future of Technology \n\nNovember 2023 \n\nChris Larson \n\n#### Artificial Intelligence \n\nNovember 2023 \n\nThomas Brewer \n\nKeep Reading Brave New World\n\n  *  Print Issue  \n  *  About  \n  *  Subscribe  \n\nStart Your Free Trial\n\nAn Outreach of Ligonier \u00a9 2025\n\n  *   *   * \n\nFrom the November 2023 Issue\n\nNov 2023 Issue", "snippet": "Thus, blockchain could potentially offer Christians greater freedom, support, and encouragement, particularly in nations where gospel proclamation is suppressed ...", "pub_date": null, "crawl_date": null, "pub_timestamp": 1698811259.0, "ref_id": "turn0search7"}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "o3-mini", "default_model_slug": "auto", "parent_id": "de3412d8-c8c4-49d7-84d5-b7b313f80764", "request_id": "912ff3f72f5938a6-SJC", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "de3412d8-c8c4-49d7-84d5-b7b313f80764", "children": ["deba80fc-4e1f-45b4-b2b8-a2af9fb8acdb"]}, "deba80fc-4e1f-45b4-b2b8-a2af9fb8acdb": {"id": "deba80fc-4e1f-45b4-b2b8-a2af9fb8acdb", "message": {"id": "deba80fc-4e1f-45b4-b2b8-a2af9fb8acdb", "author": {"role": "tool", "name": "web.search", "metadata": {"real_author": "tool:web.search"}}, "create_time": 1739734259.547698, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "sonic_webpage", "url": "https://www.instagram.com/psanctuarymaine/", "domain": "www.instagram.com", "title": "Psanctuary Church Maine (@psanctuarymaine) - Instagram", "text": "\ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue201  [wordlim: 200] \u2728 Psanctuary is a robust community spanning multiple states and bolstered by over 500 devoted members and 150 ordained ministers.

The current owner, a businessperson who also runs a car dealership, bought the building in 2022 for $2.2 million.\n\nProof of Work vs Proof of Stake: Which is Better?

However, when asked about the possibility of groups with opposing beliefs, like Satanists, buying tokens, Bush replied:\n\n> Let's introduce you to Jesus.\n\nThe Colorado House of Prayer's decision to tokenize the chapel shows how modern technology can be used to achieve spiritual goals.\n\nIn other news, in June, Galaxy Digital and the co-founder of Animoca Brands tokenized a 1708 Stradivarius Violin.\n\n  \n\n Gode S.

Nothing immediately gave away their purpose, though from a distance, onlookers would miss the hints \u2014 the neon mushroom-themed blanket on which two church founders sat, the references to \u201cthe mushroom space\u201d dotting the conversation throughout the afternoon.\n\nThis church was Psanctuary: The Sacred Mushroom Church, a religious organization in Louisville that uses psilocybin mushrooms, which have psychedelic properties, in their religious practices and regards them as a tool for communing with a higher power and nature. Like in most of the country, psilocybin mushrooms are illegal in Kentucky. The \u201csacred mushrooms,\u201d as the church often calls them, are a Schedule I controlled substance that can carry a punishment of up to three years for possession, but registered 508(c)(1)(a) churches like Psanctuary have certain legal protections they say allow them to use mushrooms in controlled worship contexts. This afternoon\u2019s gathering, their fourth of its kind since the church\u2019s inception in 2021, was, in their phrasing, a \u201csubtle sacrament encounter\u201d \u2014 less than a full trip experience (a \u201ccongregational communion\u201d), but a communion with the world nonetheless, by way of mushrooms.\u00a0\n\nFirst, though, the congregants shared their intentions for the day \u2014 \u201cto be me,\u201d \u201cto find myself again,\u201d to be a good representation for the church \u2014 as well as what they were grateful for. A young Psanctuary cleric in training, Tristan Harris, said he was looking forward to the chance to \u201cconnect with you all and with this\u201d \u2014 he patted the earth \u2014 \u201cbig ball.\u201d\n\nPsanctuary\u2019s founder and minister, 43-year-old Eric Osborne, pulled a small Pyrex container out of a tote bag. Inside it was a collection of small psilocybin mushroom caps, tiny things, each one 0.10 grams and barely bigger than a fingertip.\u00a0\n\nA \u201csacred mushroom,\u201d Eric told the group, \u201cis just a gift of nature,\u201d one you \u201cdon\u2019t even have to grow\u201d \u2014 \u201cjust got to pick \u2018em and there they are.\u201d\n\n\u201cHeaven\u2019s right here,\u201d he said, \u201cif we allow it to be.\u201d\n\nHis wife Courtney McClure, Psanctuary\u2019s secretary and co-founder, had already passed around a clipboard with a waiver, which all nine people in the circle (except me) had signed. The group was a small fraction of the approximately 30 local members and the 120 or so internationally who make up the church \u2014 technically, the \u201cnon-denominational, international faith-based community.\u201d\n\n click to enlarge  \n\nEric Osborne, the founder and minister of Sanctuary, holds a collection of psilocybin mushroom caps, which his church considers sacred. | All photos by Carolyn Brown\n\nEric distributed the mushroom caps, and, together, each group member popped theirs into their mouth in an instant. A few winced at the taste.\n\nOnce everyone had eaten their cap, Courtney read the church\u2019s statement of faith:\n\n\u201cWe believe that Sacred Mushrooms are a primary source of personal and divine revelation. We seek counsel from the mushroom, to find direction and inspiration in our faith practice. And we believe that all individuals who seek true revelation from Divinity can do so.\u201d\n\nPsanctuary uses psilocybin mushrooms the way they do because they\u2019re a registered 508(c)(1)(A) organization, and the Kentucky Religious Freedom Restoration Act prohibits the government from \u201csubstantially burden[ing] a person\u2019s exercise of religion.\u201d That\u2019d be true if they were a \u201cnormal\u201d church, too, but their exercise of religion involves something most churches, to put it mildly, would likely frown upon.\u00a0\n\nStill, Psanctuary\u2019s exercise of religion is about connecting people to mushrooms in a way that goes beyond a list of thou-shalt-nots.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe want to change the culture around religious experiences and psychedelic experiences,\u201d Eric told LEO. \u201cI\u2019m not against recreational psychedelics, but that\u2019s not how they\u2019re best applied. If you really believe, like we do, that these mushrooms are a sacrament that can connect you to your higher power, then they should be used intentionally.\u201d\u00a0\n\n#### Going To Church\u00a0\n\nThere were nine of us that afternoon (plus two dogs), and we sat on blankets in groups of two and three. Eric and Courtney shared one that was decorated with designs of psychedelically colored mushrooms, a gift from a therapist who\u2019d worked with their former upscale wellness retreat business in Jamaica, MycoMeditations. Their dog Smokey lay in the grass in front of them.\n\nYoung husband and wife Tristan and Cassie Harris sat on a pink blanket with their dog Luna, who often trotted away from the group throughout the afternoon, prompting one of them to follow after her. Tristan, the aforementioned Psanctuary cleric in training, hails from Pike County. After he finishes the eight-week training process, he\u2019ll be able to help Eric (and/or Psanctuary\u2019s two ministers in training) officiate sacrament experiences while getting paid for it. (Other church members will be able to train as ministers in a 10-month program starting on May 25.)\n\nI shared a green blanket with Alex, a tall, gentle-voiced guy who asked that LEO not share his last name. I was the only one present who had never tried psychedelics of any sort; my closest foray into that world was one incredibly underwhelming experience smoking weed in California.\u00a0\n\nPsanctuary co-founder and treasurer Athena Short joined an older couple, Stephen and Nancy Headland, on a white blanket across from Eric and Courtney.\n\nUnlike everyone else in the group that day, the Headlands, two founding members of Psanctuary\u2019s congregation, do not live in Kentucky \u2014 yet. They hail from Paso Robles, a sunny, semi-rural town in California\u2019s wine country. They\u2019re so new, in fact, that a reference to planning an event around Thunder Over Louisville confused them: \u201cI thought you had the ability to predict actual thunder in the sky!\u201d laughed Nancy.\n\nThey were in Louisville for the week for a \u201cfact-finding mission\u201d \u2014 looking at neighborhoods, scouting out potential places to live. So far, so good: they\u2019d loved the welcoming and diverse locals and had not \u201cmet anybody who was cross or even looked cross; everybody\u2019s been super friendly,\u201d Nancy said. They\u2019re looking forward to having four weather seasons, even thunderstorms, and to making use of the city\u2019s sizable park system. Their plan is to be here in August \u2014 around the one-year anniversary of them joining Psanctuary.\n\nIn fact, they\u2019re moving to Louisville because of Psanctuary.\n\n click to enlarge  \n\nNancy and Stephen Headland share their experiences with mushrooms with other members of Psanctuary.\n\nStephen and Nancy had both met Eric and had had experiences with mushrooms before joining the church; after they\u2019d each attended a MycoMeditations retreat a few years ago (albeit not at the same time), they\u2019d come back to the U.S. feeling transformed, \u201clighter,\u201d with an impetus to make huge changes in their lives.\n\n\u201cWhile not a panacea and not a magic bullet,\u201d said Stephen, who has given up all drinking and smoking since his retreat experience, psilocybin mushrooms \u201creally awakened in me the idea that things could be different \u2014 things could change.\u201d\n\nThey continued to keep up with Eric through his podcasts, \u201cPsilocybin Says\u201d and \u201cThe Psilocybin Chronicles,\u201d and joined the church last year; they\u2019re the first non-founding members whose faces you see in Psanctuary\u2019s promotional video, which was filmed at the church\u2019s retreat in Brandenburg last September. Now, they\u2019re looking forward to being part of its in-person community and further exploring their relationship to psilocybin.\n\n\u201cEach time I commune with the mushroom, I get something out of it,\u201d Stephen told LEO. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s a little something. Sometimes it\u2019s a harsh something. Sometimes it\u2019s a soft, warm something. But there\u2019s always a lesson. I feel like the mushrooms are there to teach.\u201d\n\n#### How It Started, How It Works\u00a0\n\nPsanctuary was founded in February 2021 and held its first Zoom service on May 2, 2021. By early September 2021, when their website went live, the church had already grown to nearly 100 members, which Eric commemorated in an Instagram post: \u201cI suspect you will see this community expand rapidly as it is founded in love, compassion and honesty. Anything else is destined to fail.\u201d (Incidentally, Psanctuary\u2019s URL used to belong to a Christian church in England.)\u00a0\n\nThey finally got an in-person meeting space earlier this year.\n\nOn May 7, 2021, Psanctuary officially got its 508(c)(1)(A) status, making it a nonprofit religious organization.\u00a0\n\nA 508(c)(1)(A) organization, in layman\u2019s terms, is a church in the eyes of the law, but one that might not fit the mold of what attorney Greg Lake, a consultant and author who specializes in laws relating to entheogenic (psychedelic) religious groups like Psanctuary, calls a \u201cpicture-perfect orthodox church.\u201d If Psanctuary \u2014 which is one of his clients \u2014 were to file as a 501(c)(3) church, the more traditional option, they\u2019d essentially be \u201casking the IRS to comment on validity of [their] religion,\u201d Lake said.\n\nIn any case, Lake said, the practice of using psychedelic substances spiritually has existed for millennia so Psanctuary is, in a sense, nothing new. About groups like Psanctuary, he told LEO, \u201cYou can\u2019t regulate these things out of existence.\u201d\n\n click to enlarge  \n\nMembers of Psanctuary discuss their faith on a Sunday afternoon as part of a \u201csubtle sacrament encounter,\u201d an afternoon that involves hiking in a Louisville park and microdosing psilocybin mushrooms.\n\nA 2002 article in the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies [MAPS] Bulletin, a journal published by the foremost authorities on psychedelic research, noted close to 40 churches and religious organizations in North America and Europe (many of which are now defunct, in part due to legal threats) that have centered their religious practices around cannabis, ayahuasca, peyote and, of course, psilocybin mushrooms. The landmark U.S. v. Boyll case in 1990 ensured that members of a Native American religious group that used peyote (even non-Native members like Boyll himself) were exempt from laws that criminalized the use of peyote because they did so in \u201cbona fide religious ceremonies.\u201d\n\nPsanctuary says it exercises using mushrooms under the auspices of the Kentucky Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a successor to the original federal law passed by Bill Clinton in 1993 that was struck down in 1997. It reads:\u00a0\n\n\u201cGovernment shall not substantially burden a person\u2019s freedom of religion. The right to act or refuse to act in a manner motivated by a sincerely held religious belief may not be substantially burdened unless the government proves by clear and convincing evidence that it has a compelling governmental interest in infringing the specific act or refusal to act and has used the least restrictive means to further that interest. A \u2018burden\u2019 shall include indirect burdens such as withholding benefits, assessing penalties, or an exclusion from programs or access to facilities.\u201d\n\nGov. Steve Beshear vetoed the bill in 2013, citing concerns that it would \u201ccause serious unintentional consequences that could threaten public safety, health care and individuals\u2019 civil rights,\u201d according to a statement at the time, but a Republican-majority General Assembly overrode his veto. In various states, laws like this one have been used in cases about LGBT discrimination and vaccine mandates, among other issues, but they have, in general, been a boon for members of psychedelic churches.\u00a0\n\nBut, as Eric told me: \u201cWe are practicing our sincere faith. And until someone can prove to us that it is insincere and that we are putting the public at risk, then we\u2019re going to keep on practicing our faith.\u201d\n\n#### \u2018Intense And Intentional\u2019\n\nPeople who think Psanctuary is solely about eating psychedelic mushrooms will be sorely disappointed. Much of the \u201cwork\u201d of being in the church is about talking with fellow congregants.\n\nOf course, Psanctuary\u2019s ministry is chiefly focused on psilocybin mushrooms and their benefits. Even their logo is a stylization of the underside of a mushroom cap, with the mushroom\u2019s gills radiating out from what appears to be an eye in the middle.\u00a0\n\nLikewise, Psanctuary has their semantic particularities. Psilocybin mushrooms themselves are often referred to singularly as \u201cthe mushroom\u201d or \u201cthe sacrament,\u201d variably with or without capitalization, or sometimes \u201csacred mushrooms.\u201d Eating mushrooms is \u201cpartaking in the sacrament.\u201d A trip itself is a \u201csacrament experience\u201d; microdosing is a \u201csubtle sacrament experience.\u201d A bad trip is a \u201cchallenging experience.\u201d One\u2019s headspace during a trip is \u201cthe mushroom space.\u201d A group trip is \u201ccongregational communion.\u201d Their name, of course, is \u201cPsanctuary,\u201d spelled with a P like in \u201cpsychedelic\u201d and \u201cpsilocybin,\u201d and their twice-monthly meetings are known as \u201cPsacred Circles.\u201d Sunday services and some emails end with the send-off \u201cMush love.\u201d\n\nStill, the \u201ctrip\u201d experiences \u2014 both the subtle sacrament encounters like the one last Sunday and their multi-day retreats \u2014 are only a fraction of their overall ministry, and they\u2019re members-only at that. To become one, you have to pay a nonrefundable one-time fee of $35, then choose your monthly giving tier \u2014 $10, $20 or $30, plus a $0.50, $1 or $1.50 processing fee, respectively. (It\u2019s a sliding scale system; all tiers have the same benefits.) After that, you fill out an application, then sign their code of ethics and liability waiver. Once that\u2019s done, you schedule a call with the founders to talk about the church and your intentions with joining. Members have access to the congregation\u2019s Telegram channel and Discord server.\n\n click to enlarge  \n\nCassie Harris takes part in a meditation at the end of Psanctuary\u2019s \u201csubtle sacrament encounter.\"\n\nAs you might expect, they\u2019ve had to turn away people who\u2019ve come to the church only for an easy supply of mushrooms. Those people, Eric said, will \u201cpretty quickly exit themselves out\u201d after hearing the in-depth and personal conversations that Psanctuary members have at their in-person and virtual gatherings.\n\n\u201cBecause we are so sincere, we are so intense and intentional behind what we\u2019re doing, if that\u2019s not what you\u2019re into, then you\u2019re gonna go find somewhere else to do drugs. That\u2019s easy,\u201d he told LEO. Anybody can find someone to do mushrooms with, he added, but \u201cnot just anybody can come and sit and have a two-hour conversation about their own real personal vulnerabilities or pain and trauma.\u201d\n\nThose two-hour events \u2014 bi-monthly Psacred Circles in person and weekly Sunday Services on Zoom \u2014 make up the bulk of the church\u2019s programming, though their recent and upcoming events also include mindfulness sessions, a cacao ceremony and a silent disco vendor\u2019s market.\u00a0\n\nTheir in-person events take place inside a cozy studio space on East Broadway, where the only thing immediately indicating its purpose is a string of decorative mushrooms right inside the entrance. Potted plants sit atop a cubby shelf; paintings by Eric \u2014 a poinsettia, some Van Gogh-esque plants \u2014 add color to one of the exposed brick walls.\u00a0\n\nI went to both the Community Psacred Circle on Tuesday, March 29, led by Eric; and the Women\u2019s Psacred Circle on Saturday, April 2, led by Courtney.\n\nEric\u2019s circle was heavily mushroom-focused. There were 10 of us \u2014 all men, except for Athena and me \u2014 but our conversations focused more on mental health, trauma, organized religion and the pros and cons of using mushrooms for healing. Alex spoke heartfeltly about the concept of communion.\u00a0\n\nAt the women\u2019s circle, Courtney asked us to keep anything personal that was shared inside the circle fully inside the circle, to which we all agreed. Still, I can say that it was slightly larger than the previous one \u2014 there were 14 of us, including one service dog, but we were all female.\u00a0\n\nWe didn\u2019t talk about mushrooms, though \u2014 we talked about emotions. We did a \u201cbody scan meditation,\u201d then played several rounds of \u201cThe Noticing Game,\u201d where we shared observations about how we (collectively and individually) were feeling and existing in the space. It wasn\u2019t always easy; I struggled to come up with a response on two of the four rounds, but it helped us connect as a group.\n\nThe word \u201cPsanctuary\u201d didn\u2019t even come up until the very end, right before Courtney concluded the group and offered people slices of homemade hawthorn berry heart cake.\n\n#### The Road To Psanctuary\n\nThe long journey to Psanctuary didn\u2019t begin with a prayer to God or a cry for salvation or a Bible verse. It began with another walk in the woods.\u00a0\n\nEric was 19 in 1999, a student at St. Catharine College, a small, now-shuttered Catholic school near his hometown of Springfield, Kentucky, working on an associate degree in liberal studies. He\u2019d graduated from a Catholic high school a few years earlier.\u00a0\n\nBy that point, though, he\u2019d already started to question the faith he was brought up in.\n\n\u201cAs I got older, I started to see that where I really felt in touch with God was not in the Church,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, I was fully bought into the Catholic thing. When the pedophilia scandal broke out, by then, I\u2019d already started to really question the validity of what I was engaged with all the time. But then I just said, \u2018Look, this is hogwash. This is corrupt to its core.\u2019\u201d\n\nDisillusionment with the Church led him to explore nature more \u2014 to spend more time in the woods, hiking and hunting for mushrooms, initially for food.\n\nWhen he discovered psychedelic mushrooms, it was a revelation. Years of church experience had failed to give him a spiritual connection, yet here was something that could \u2014 something \u201creal and direct\u201d and \u201cnot a theoretical thing anymore.\u201d\u00a0\n\nEric was already plenty familiar with the sacrament of communion, how, in the Catholic Church, through the process of transubstantiation, a thin wafer gets transformed by the priest into the body of Christ.\n\nBut a psychedelic mushroom \u2014 this did not need to be consecrated. To him, it was already holy and perfect by its own existence. It was a doorway to God, nature and the universe, and he could hold it between his fingertips.\n\nStill, after he transferred to UofL and graduated in 2004, he taught English for a few years at a Catholic middle school in Louisville.\n\nIn 2009, he made a complete pivot: he started a mushroom farm, Magnificent Mushrooms, in rural Paoli, Indiana, about an hour northwest of downtown Louisville. He would have preferred to have stayed in Kentucky, he said, but a board member at his school had an empty farm and needed someone to maintain it, so the opportunity was there.\n\nEric turned the farm into a thriving business that grew close to 15 different varieties of mushrooms over the course of its time in Paoli. He grew 100-150 pounds of edible mushrooms a week for restaurants, private caterers and a grocery store in Louisville and Southern Indiana. Locally, his clients included Le Relais, Harvest (which has since closed) and the Wiltshire group. He led educational workshops about the benefits of mushrooms \u2014 both edible and psilocybin. In 2011, the Indiana State Department of Health recognized Eric as a wild mushroom identification expert.\n\nOn April 8, 2013, he met Courtney McClure, a former competitive figure skater who was then working at the Middletown branch of the local health food market Rainbow Blossom. They married in October 2016, and they now have four children between them, including two from Eric\u2019s previous marriages.\n\nIn November 2013, Eric started leading trips to Jamaica \u2014 where psychedelics are legal \u2014 with MycoMeditations, the wellness retreat company he\u2019d founded the year before. MycoMeditations, which specializes in high-end psilocybin-assisted retreats, offers guests guided mushroom trips and licensed therapists in an ocean-front environment in an attempt to combat depression, anxiety, PTSD and addiction.\n\nBut in June 2015, Courtney and Eric entered what he calls \u201cthe worst, hardest period of our lives\u201d when police raided their 87-acre Magnificent Mushrooms farm in Indiana and took them away to jail.\n\n click to enlarge  \n\nEric Osborne, right, and his wife Courtney McClure, left, are both co-founders of Psanctuary.\n\nThe Paoli Police Department said officers found five pounds of psilocybin mushrooms and seven pounds of cannabis butter on the property (though, Eric disputes this, claiming that officers included the weight of the dirt in the mushroom weight, and that there were \u201cprobably only three ounces\u201d of weed in the butter).\n\nArrested on a slew of drug charges, Courtney was locked up for a day before getting bailed out while Eric was held in jail for eight days. After their release, they\u2019d spend eight weeks on home incarceration. In the end, they were sentenced to two and a half years of probation.\n\nThey say the relatively lenient outcome was likely because they were both white and neither one had an arrest record.\n\n\u201cPeople\u2019s lives are taken away every day because of plants,\u201d Courtney said.\n\nDespite the ordeal, Eric managed to give off a slight smile in his mugshot as he posed against the white cinderblock walls.\n\n\u201cI was doing my best to smile because this has always been my faith and practice. I have always had some kind of trust in the mushroom, and I trust the process,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though that was a horrifying day, there was still a part of me that knew everything was gonna work out, that still had that faith.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, he and Courtney moved to Treasure Beach, Jamaica, to restart Magnificent Mushrooms and continue MycoMeditations.\n\nStill, Eric said, he missed his home state. In Jamaica, he\u2019d often play John Prine\u2019s \u201cMy Old Kentucky Home, Goodnight,\u201d and he even adopted a dog named Kentucky. (She\u2019s still doing well, but she now lives on a hemp farm, where she has more room to run around that she needed than she had at Eric and Courtney\u2019s house.)\n\nEric decided to leave Myco in late 2020; his replacement, Justin Townsend, is a former Myco facilitator who has since become CEO and head facilitator. (Currently, the cheapest option via MycoMeditations is a week-long \u201cClassic Retreat\u201d that starts at $4,300 per person for a double occupancy and $5,550 for single occupancy.)\n\nSince then, Eric and Courtney started a podcast, \u201cPsilocybin Says,\u201d in April 2021; founded a psychedelic coaching business, More Than Integration in May 2021 and started Psanctuary the same month.\u00a0\n\nEric treasured his time in Treasure Beach, but now, he\u2019s back in Louisville, continuing to share his beliefs about psilocybin mushrooms.\n\n\u201cI just love Kentucky,\u201d he told LEO. \u201cI want to help people heal here.\u201d\n\n#### Out Of The Woods\u00a0\n\nBack in the park, I caught Alex staring up intently at a bare tree and went over to photograph the moment. He said he was appreciating the patterns of its branches and how new leaves were coming in; still, he shied away from a photo because he \u201ccan\u2019t be natural now that I know there\u2019s a camera.\u201d I looked over at Athena, who was having fun on a nearby swing set. Tristan and Luna followed shortly after, and Cassie took photos of them on her phone. A few minutes later, Courtney took Tristan\u2019s place. Both she and Athena were wearing flowers in their hair. They were giddy and happy and eventually tried to synchronize their swinging before they jumped off, which they asked me to photograph.\n\nWhile this was happening, others in our group were chatting with parkgoers about the tribulations of using the grody bathrooms \u2014 this one doesn\u2019t lock; that one has no toilet paper.\n\nA realization struck me: those people have no idea that our group is microdosing.\n\nIt also struck me: any of them could be microdosing right now, too.\n\nAt that point, we\u2019d been hiking around the park for about an hour, walking along the trails and admiring a broad expanse of flowers that spread out gorgeously under the trees. As we walked, at one point joyfully passing a turtle sunning itself on a rock, everybody was in good spirits. Stephen said the mushrooms were giving him a heightened appreciation for the nature that surrounded us \u2014 they were making the nice day feel like a \u201cnice day squared.\u201d\n\nAs we made our way down the pedestrian side of a long stretch of road, and I spotted our blankets through the trees, which lay like gigantic flower petals through the barren woods.\n\nBy the time we returned to the circle, it was already 3:45 p.m. The harsh earlier light had already mellowed; the shadows had softened. Courtney offered people some chocolate as she and others sat down, basking in the beautiful day. Eric walked around with Smokey; Tristan reclined on a fallen tree nearby.\n\nNot long after, we all gathered together again. For two hours, as the sun continued to fall slowly behind the trees, we just talked \u2014 about psilocybin, dreams, mushroom hunting, palliative care, divinity, stigma, consciousness, past lives, infinity, ego deaths and relationships, amongst many other topics.\n\nAt one point, Eric relayed a story: a client who had debated whether or not he should work with Eric (and ultimately did so) went to a psychic about the matter. The psychic said that this was Eric\u2019s \u201clast incarnation\u201d on Earth.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t buy it,\u201d Eric said. \u201cI wanna keep coming back.\u201d\n\n click to enlarge  \n\nFrom left: Nancy Headland, Athena Short, and Cassie Harris relax after Psanctuary\u2019s \u201csubtle sacrament encounter\u201d hike.\n\nWe concluded with a mindfulness meditation.\n\nIt was quiet and peaceful. Some sounds overlaid each other: soft piano music from Courtney\u2019s Bluetooth speaker, which pulsed rainbow colors; mourning doves, cars, a slight breeze.\n\nNancy told the group she\u2019d had a feeling of something right before the timer went off to end the meditation. When she opened her eyes, she was staring right at Luna, who stared directly back at her.\u00a0\n\nWe all laughed; Tristan congratulated his dog on being the \u201csomething\u201d \u2014 \u201cGood job, Luna.\u201d\n\nBefore the circle dispersed into a round of standing hugs, Courtney asked us to remind ourselves of the intentions we\u2019d shared hours before and consider if we\u2019d achieved them during the afternoon. One by one, the group members named them: to recenter, to represent the church, to \u201ccreate a greater connection to this soil,\u201d to \u201csoak it in\u201d \u2014 both the day and the conversation. Multiple people referenced an intention to \u201cbe present.\u201d All agreed that their intentions had been met.\n\nAs others walked out to the parking lot, I stuck around to interview the Headlands. I wanted to know more about what would bring them from California to Louisville to be part of a psychedelic mushroom church. Psychedelic mushroom experiences aren\u2019t always easy \u2014 even psychedelics experts like Eric readily admit that \u2014 and moving cross-country certainly isn\u2019t, either.\n\nBut they were ready. There were still a few months\u2019 worth of logistical preparations to account for, but they already knew what the mushroom \u2014 and the Psanctuary community \u2014 had done, and would continue to do, for them both.\n\nWe continued talking as we walked to the parking lot, backlit by the peak of golden hour. At one point, we stopped \u2014 unintentionally \u2014 right in front of a single yellow wildflower, which grew alone in a big expanse of grass.\n\nNancy was elated. It was a serendipitous moment, she said \u2014 a beautifully-timed parallel for their upcoming move to Louisville.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gonna work out the way it\u2019s supposed to work out, and things just keep aligning themselves,\u201d she said. \u201cAs we move forward in our journey in this move, things are just working out. And that, to me, is serendipitous. It tells me that we are on the right path, and this is what we need to do.\u201d\u00a0\n\nKeep Louisville interesting and support LEO Weekly by subscribing to our newsletter here.

One major sector that has gone overlooked is the nonprofits industry. Unbeknownst to many, the nonprofit sector is a significant player in the American economy. The United States is home to nearly one and a half million nonprofit organizations, employing more people than the construction, finance, and transportation industries.\n\nNonprofits contribute nearly two trillion dollars to the American economy annually. Nonprofits come in many shapes and sizes, including hospitals, churches, universities, museums, zoos, and charities. With widespread adoption, blockchain technology will have lasting impacts on all these institutions.\n\nThis is the first in a series of blog posts that will discuss various blockchain technologies and how each applies in the nonprofit context. Part I will introduce blockchain technology, Part II will discuss smart contracts, Part III will cover decentralized autonomous organizations, and Part IV will explore cryptocurrencies.\n\nBefore discussing the various blockchain technologies and how they can apply to nonprofits, it is important to define what blockchain is and how it works.\n\n## What is Blockchain?\n\n\u00a0Blockchain is a digital ledger that records information distributed among a network of computers. Blockchains consist of a series of digital blocks that are securely linked together using cryptography.\n\nThese blocks record information such as financial transactions, agreements between parties, and ownership records. Each computer is the network is called a node, and each node stores a copy of the blockchain. The nodes form a peer-to-peer network, where updates are shared and synchronized between all nodes.\n\nBlockchain technology eliminates the need for the third-party intermediaries, such as banks or government agencies, which traditionally have ensured the integrity of transactions and records. Instead, blockchains maintain agreement between all participants using a what is known as a consensus protocol.\n\nA consensus protocol is a set of rules that allows nodes to determine when to add new information to the blockchain. The consensus protocol makes blockchains resistant to tampering.\n\nFundamentally, blockchain is a process of facilitating transactions in the following manner. First, a transaction is initiated. Next, the transaction is broadcasted to every node in the network. Then, the nodes form a consensus on whether the transaction is valid.\n\nTo form the consensus, the nodes each attempt to solve extremely complex mathematical puzzles. This process is called validation. As soon as a node validates a transaction, the node adds the transaction to a block and the block to the blockchain, thus completing the transaction. As the name suggests, blocks are strung together to form a blockchain.\n\nEach individual block contains a piece of information about the previous block. Because of this, in order for a previous block in the chain to be altered, a node would have to not only validate the next block in the chain, but it would have to also validate every other block that comes after that next one.\n\nThis is nearly impossible for a single node to accomplish on its own. Accordingly, blockchain is often referred to as a highly secure immutable ledger.\n\nThis series will dive into three emerging blockchain technologies: smart contracts, decentralized autonomous organizations, and cryptocurrencies. We will introduce the technologies, how each functions, and describe how they might apply in the nonprofit sector.\n\nRelated read: Blockchain Applications in the Nonprofit Sector Part 2, Part 3, and Part 4\n\nSources:\n\n[1] National Council on Nonprofits, Nonprofit Impact Matters: How America\u2019s Charitable Nonprofits Strengthen Communities and Improve Lives (2019).\n\n2 Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, What is Blockchain?

Here are some potential applications:\n\n### 1. Transparent Donations and Fundraising  \nUsing blockchain, the church could set up smart contracts to process donations and fundraising campaigns. Every transaction would be recorded on an immutable ledger, providing donors with clear, real\u2010time insights into how funds are used. This increased transparency builds trust and accountability within the community.  \n\ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue201\n\n### 2. Secure Membership and Digital Identity Management  \nPsanctuary\u2019s inclusive, community-focused model might benefit from blockchain-based digital identities. Members could receive secure, verifiable credentials that simplify membership registration, protect personal data, and ensure that participation records\u2014such as attendance at sacramental services or minister ordinations\u2014remain accurate and tamper-proof.  \n\ue200cite\ue202turn0search12\ue201\n\n### 3. Asset Tokenization and Community Investment  \nTaking inspiration from blockchain tokenization models used by other churches, Psanctuary could explore issuing digital tokens. These tokens might represent membership shares or stake in future community projects, allowing members to invest collectively in the church\u2019s growth and infrastructure while fostering a sense of shared ownership.  \n\ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue201\n\n### 4. Decentralized Governance  \nBlockchain platforms can facilitate decentralized decision-making processes. By implementing a voting system based on blockchain, Psanctuary could enable its members to participate directly in governance\u2014aligning with its non-dogmatic, non-hierarchical ethos\u2014and ensuring decisions are made transparently and democratically.\n\n### 5. Immutable Record Keeping for Sacraments and Ordinations  \nMaintaining secure, permanent records of sacramental events and ministerial ordinations on a blockchain would safeguard these critical documents.

Here\u2019s how blockchain applications can be adapted to reflect holacracy governance:\n\n### 1. Transparent Donations and Fundraising  \nUsing smart contracts on a blockchain, the church can run donation campaigns and fundraising efforts with complete transparency. Every contribution is immutably recorded, giving donors real\u2010time insight into fund allocation and reinforcing the accountability valued in both blockchain and holacracy systems.  \n\ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue201\n\n### 2. Secure Membership and Digital Identity Management  \nBlockchain-based digital identities enable secure, verifiable credentials for members. This not only streamlines the registration process and protects personal data but also supports holacracy by ensuring that each member\u2019s role and responsibilities are clearly recorded and accessible across the decentralized organization.  \n\ue200cite\ue202turn0search12\ue201\n\n### 3. Asset Tokenization and Community Investment  \nInspired by models in other blockchain-enabled churches, Psanctuary could issue digital tokens representing membership stakes or shares in community projects. This approach fosters collective investment and shared ownership while resonating with holacracy\u2019s emphasis on distributed control and community-driven decision making.  \n\ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue201\n\n### 4. Holacracy-Driven Decentralized Governance  \nBlockchain platforms can be tailored to support holacracy governance by facilitating role-based decision making and real-time, secure voting among autonomous circles. An immutable ledger of decisions can be maintained on the blockchain, ensuring that every role\u2019s input and every circle\u2019s resolutions are transparently recorded. This decentralized system enhances accountability and reflects the church\u2019s non-hierarchical ethos by enabling self-organizing teams to govern their own processes.  \n\n### 5. Immutable Record Keeping for Sacraments and Ordinations  \nRecording sacramental events and ministerial ordinations on a blockchain ensures that these critical records are secure, tamper-proof, and permanently accessible. This not only preserves the church\u2019s history but also supports the holacracy model by clearly documenting each decision and role transition without centralized oversight.\n\n### Conclusion  \nBy integrating blockchain technology with holacracy governance, Psanctuary church can enhance transparency, empower community-driven decision making, and maintain immutable records\u2014all while staying true to its innovative, non-hierarchical ethos.

Here\u2019s how this integration might look in practice:\n\n### 1. Privacy-Preserving Donation and Fundraising  \n- **Secure Transparency:** Donations can be processed via smart contracts on the Aleo network. Zero-knowledge proofs allow the church to publicly verify that funds are allocated according to predetermined rules without revealing donor identities or sensitive financial details.  \n- **Enhanced Trust:** Donors can independently verify that every transaction complies with the church\u2019s transparent fundraising policies while their privacy remains intact.  \n\ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue201\n\n### 2. Confidential Membership and Digital Identity Management  \n- **Privacy-First Identities:** Members could receive blockchain-based digital credentials that use zero-knowledge proofs to authenticate their roles within the holacracy. This means members can prove their eligibility and responsibilities without exposing personal data.  \n- **Decentralized Role Tracking:** Each member\u2019s role, contributions, and participation in decentralized decision-making circles can be recorded on-chain in an encrypted form, ensuring that sensitive details are visible only to authorized parties.  \n\ue200cite\ue202turn0search12\ue201\n\n### 3. Secure Tokenization for Community Investment  \n- **Programmable Privacy for Tokens:** When issuing community tokens\u2014whether they represent shares in church projects or stakes in collective assets\u2014Aleo\u2019s programmable privacy ensures individual token balances and transactions remain confidential.  \n- **Collective Ownership:** While the overall token economy remains transparent for governance and accountability, the details of personal investments are kept private, aligning with both the spirit of decentralized holacracy and the need for personal privacy.  \n\ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue201\n\n### 4. Holacracy-Driven Decentralized Governance with Private Voting  \n- **Confidential Decision Making:** In a holacracy, decision-making is distributed across autonomous circles. Using zero-knowledge proofs, members can cast votes or submit proposals privately, ensuring that individual opinions are protected while the validity of the vote is cryptographically verifiable.  \n- **Immutable and Private Records:** Each decision or role assignment is recorded on the blockchain in a manner that\u2019s immutable and transparent at a macro level, yet the underlying sensitive data remains encrypted\u2014achieving both accountability and privacy.  \n\n### 5. Immutable Record Keeping for Sacraments and Ordinations  \n- **Secure Documentation:** Critical events such as sacraments or ministerial ordinations can be recorded using Aleo\u2019s blockchain features. Zero-knowledge proofs allow these records to be validated publicly without exposing personal or sensitive information.  \n- **Trust and Verification:** This immutable ledger supports both the historical integrity of the church\u2019s records and the community\u2019s ability to verify these records without compromising individual privacy.\n\n### Conclusion  \nBy integrating Aleo\u2019s zero-knowledge proofs and programmable privacy, Psanctuary church can realize a blockchain ecosystem that supports holacracy governance in a way that is both transparent and privacy-centric. This approach allows the church to manage donations, memberships, community investments, and governance processes securely\u2014empowering self-organizing teams while protecting sensitive data and individual privacy.

Introduction & Vision Statement\nPsanctuary Coin is envisioned as more than just a digital currency\u2014it is a spiritual tool and community resource designed to nurture a decentralized, transparent, and compassionate ecosystem. Grounded in the belief that true abundance comes from collective giving and shared responsibility, Psanctuary Coin aims to bridge traditional spiritual values with cutting-edge blockchain technology. Our vision is to create an economy that honors sacred practices, fosters global community engagement, and empowers individuals to contribute to collective well-being.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Problem Statement: Why Psanctuary Coin is Needed\nModern financial systems often lack transparency and accessibility, particularly for communities driven by shared values rather than profit. Traditional fundraising models and centralized governance structures can create barriers to true communal participation and limit the flow of resources needed for social and spiritual growth. Psanctuary Coin is designed to address these challenges by:\n- Providing a transparent, immutable ledger for donations and expenditures.\n- Empowering communities through decentralized decision-making.\n- Ensuring that the spiritual and ethical dimensions of giving are recognized and rewarded.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Solution & Core Principles\nPsanctuary Coin offers a solution anchored in the following core principles:\n\n- **Transparency:** Every transaction and decision is recorded on an immutable blockchain ledger. Donors, members, and stakeholders can verify the use of funds without compromising personal privacy.\n- **Abundance:** Built on a model that promotes continual giving, Psanctuary Coin is designed to circulate wealth within the community, supporting projects and initiatives that uplift spiritual and social well-being.\n- **Proof-of-Giving:** Inspired by traditional acts of service, this innovative concept rewards members for their generosity. Validators and community members earn rewards for demonstrating consistent, impactful giving.\n- **Holacracy & Decentralization:** Embracing a non-hierarchical, self-organizing model, the coin\u2019s governance empowers every member through decentralized decision-making structures.\n- **Spiritual Integrity:** Every technical and operational decision is rooted in a deep commitment to spiritual values, ensuring that technology serves to enhance\u2014not replace\u2014the sacred experience.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Tokenomics\nPsanctuary Coin is designed with the following token economic model:\n\n- **Unlimited Supply Model:** Rather than a fixed supply, the coin embraces an unlimited issuance model to continuously support communal growth. The issuance is controlled by community consensus and adjusted based on real-world giving metrics.\n- **Staking Mechanism:** Members can stake their coins to support network operations. In return, stakers receive rewards, reinforcing long-term participation.\n- **Validator Rewards:** Validators who help secure the network through transaction verification earn rewards. These rewards are proportionate to their contribution and help maintain the network\u2019s integrity.\n- **Treasury Structure:** A portion of transaction fees is allocated to a communal treasury. These funds support community projects, maintenance of spiritual programs, and future development initiatives\u2014all managed transparently via on-chain voting.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Governance Model\nThe governance of Psanctuary Coin is built on a blend of decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) principles and a trust-based, spiritually guided decision-making process:\n\n- **DAO Structure:** Decisions regarding protocol changes, treasury allocations, and strategic initiatives are made collectively through on-chain voting. Every token holder has a voice.\n- **Holacratic Trust:** Reflecting our non-hierarchical ethos, governance is distributed across autonomous circles. Each circle manages specific aspects (e.g., community outreach, technical development, spiritual programming) and coordinates with others in a decentralized fashion.\n- **Spiritual Decision-Making:** In addition to technical governance, a designated Spiritual Council (elected by the community) offers guidance on ethical, compassionate, and spiritually aligned decisions. Their insights are integrated into the DAO\u2019s proposals to ensure that every decision honors the sacred mission.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Technical Architecture\nPsanctuary Coin is built on a robust, substrate-based blockchain platform that supports both financial transactions and spiritual engagement through innovative features:\n\n- **Substrate-Based Framework:** Leveraging modular and customizable blockchain technology for scalability, security, and interoperability.\n- **Two-Layer Transactions:** A dual-layer system separates high-speed micro-transactions (for everyday giving and staking rewards) from larger, trust-intensive transactions (such as community investments and treasury allocations).\n- **Fee Structure:** Transaction fees are minimal and designed to recycle value back into the community treasury. Advanced mechanisms like Aleo\u2019s zero-knowledge proofs ensure that while transactions are transparent and verifiable, individual privacy is maintained.\n- **Programmable Privacy:** Leveraging zero-knowledge proofs and privacy-preserving protocols, the system ensures that sensitive personal data remains confidential while the overall integrity of the ledger is maintained.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Project Management Software & Real-World Applications\nTo bridge the gap between blockchain technology and real-world community projects, Psanctuary Coin integrates with specialized project management tools:\n\n- **Integrated PM Software:** A tailored platform will track projects, document milestones, and measure the impact of initiatives funded by the treasury. This ensures clear accountability and strategic alignment with the church\u2019s spiritual mission.\n- **Real-World Use Cases:** \n  - **Community Outreach:** Tracking charitable projects and community service initiatives.\n  - **Spiritual Programs:** Managing events, workshops, and retreats.\n  - **Infrastructure Projects:** Funding and overseeing the maintenance and expansion of church facilities or community centers.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Roadmap & Development Phases\nThe roadmap for Psanctuary Coin is divided into clear, actionable phases:\n\n- **Phase 1: Research & Design (Q3 2025)**\n  - Finalize technical architecture and tokenomics.\n  - Engage community and spiritual leaders to refine the governance model.\n- **Phase 2: Development & Testing (Q4 2025 \u2013 Q1 2026)**\n  - Build the blockchain network on a substrate-based framework.\n  - Integrate zero-knowledge proof modules for programmable privacy.\n  - Pilot the staking, validator rewards, and treasury systems.\n- **Phase 3: Community Launch & DAO Formation (Q2 2026)**\n  - Launch Psanctuary Coin and establish the DAO.\n  - Begin the initial round of on-chain governance proposals.\n- **Phase 4: Expansion & Real-World Integration (Q3 2026 and beyond)**\n  - Integrate with project management software.\n  - Roll out use cases with partner organizations.\n  - Continuously update the protocol based on community feedback and evolving spiritual needs.\n\n---\n\n## 9. Use Cases\nPsanctuary Coin\u2019s versatility allows it to be adopted across various organizations and scenarios:\n\n- **Faith-Based Communities:** Churches and spiritual centers can use the coin for transparent donation management, community voting, and funding spiritual projects.\n- **Nonprofit Organizations:** Nonprofits can benefit from an immutable ledger of giving, ensuring accountability and fostering trust among donors.\n- **Social Enterprises:** Businesses driven by social impact can utilize the coin for employee incentives, community engagement, and transparent reinvestment of profits.\n- **Collaborative Networks:** Cross-organizational alliances can adopt Psanctuary Coin for joint projects, shared governance, and pooled resources\u2014all under a trust-based, decentralized model.\n\n---\n\n## 10. Fundraising & Treasury Allocation\nPsanctuary Coin adopts a gradual, organic growth model without an initial coin offering (ICO):\n\n- **No ICO Model:** Instead of a public ICO, the coin will be distributed gradually through community participation, staking rewards, and fundraising events.\n- **Gradual Growth:** Funds are raised through a series of community initiatives, ensuring that growth is steady and sustainable.\n- **Treasury Allocation:** The treasury is managed by the DAO and Spiritual Council. Allocation of funds will be transparently decided through on-chain voting, with strict guidelines to support community projects, technical development, and ongoing spiritual programs.\n\n---\n\n## 11. Future Plans & Scalability\nLooking forward, Psanctuary Coin is designed with scalability and long-term evolution in mind:\n\n- **Protocol Upgrades:** Regular updates based on community proposals will ensure the platform remains state-of-the-art and aligned with spiritual needs.\n- **Broader Ecosystem Integration:** Plans to integrate with other decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 applications will further empower community projects and cross-organizational collaborations.\n- **Global Outreach:** As the coin and its governance model mature, Psanctuary Coin will serve as a model for other faith-based communities worldwide, fostering an interconnected network of spiritually aligned organizations.\n- **Continuous Innovation:** Ongoing research into emerging blockchain technologies (such as advanced privacy protocols and scalable consensus mechanisms) will keep the project at the forefront of digital and spiritual innovation.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\nPsanctuary Coin represents a fusion of technology and spirituality, offering a decentralized, transparent, and inclusive economic model for communities driven by compassion and collective giving. By harnessing substrate-based blockchain technology, zero-knowledge proofs, and holacratic governance, Psanctuary Coin and the Psanctuary Coin Trust pave the way for a future where every transaction, every vote, and every act of giving is both a sacred and verifiable contribution to a more abundant, interconnected world.\n\n---\n\n*This white paper is a living document and will be updated as the project evolves.
