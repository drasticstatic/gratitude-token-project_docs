## The  Mushroom Church 

The Mission of Psanctuary is to bring people together for healing and connection to divine revelation through communion with sacred mushrooms. Read more about our vision and mission here.

Psanctuary, a 508(c)(1)(A) faith-based organization, is a Constitutional Church. It is our sincere belief that the consumption of psilocybin-containing mushrooms is a communion which brings us closer to what is commonly called God, We understand this concept as pure consciousness, which permeates all being. This pure consciousness is, we believe the Ineffable Source of Creation and the origin of health and well-being. Psanctuary is a grounded, nature centered, non-dogmatic, non-hierarchical faith based organization.   

Our faith in sacred mushrooms stems from pre-historical use by our ancestors and personal experiences of our modern members. It is our belief that psilocybin containing mushrooms are one of the greatest sacraments that Nature offers, raising our awareness so that we can access a direct connection to the Source of Life.   

Our community consists of families and individuals from all walks of life and is open to individuals from any faith or background. We are an inclusive community recognizing only one race of humans and one life force that manifests in a multitude of forms and appearances.

# Welcome to Psanctuary, America’s First Magic Mushroom Church

  * October 8, 2021

As magic mushrooms and other psychedelics are increasingly accepted in modern western society, approaches to integrating these medicines into the existing legal landscape via decriminalization, medicalization, and/or legalization has gotten a lot of attention. 

Yet one approach that doesn’t attract much discussion and won’t be going on a voter’s ballot anytime soon is already legally operating in a small town in Kentucky. 

Psanctuary, a faith-based, non-denominational organization—a  508(c)(1)(A) faith-based organization in U.S. legal talk— is perhaps the first ever magic mushroom church in the United States solely devoted to the use of psilocybin, or “magic,” mushrooms as its one and only sacrament. 

This approach, instead of fighting an uphill battle against existing U.S. drug laws, utilizes the strength of America’s religious freedom laws and precedents to create a legal framework for the safe, open use of magic mushrooms. 

A couple weeks ago, our very own Sam the Mushroom Man sat down with Eric Osborne, a founding member of Psanctuary, to talk about his path to starting a magic mushroom church, how Psanctuary currently operates, and where he hopes it goes from here. 

A transcript of that conversation follows, condensed and edited for length and readability.

#### What was your first introduction to psilocybin like, and how has that relationship evolved to today, where you’re a founding member of Psanctuary? 

“My introduction to psilocybin, I was 19. It was recreational. But I very quickly came to understand this as a spiritual access point, if you will. It was probably two years after I was introduced to psilocybin when I got into cultivating culinary mushrooms. That became the biggest part of my mycological focus for probably about 10 years. I ended up starting a gourmet mushroom farm in Indiana. All the while, I was growing a little bit of psilocybin for myself for personal use and would give it away to friends, stuff like that.

In 2009, when I moved to a farm up in Indiana, I started growing psilocybin on a considerably larger scale. That’s when my relationship with psilocybin really started to take off, not necessarily because I was growing so much but because living where I was, it afforded me the opportunity to work with other people. It gave me the opportunity to really start working dedicatedly, mainly with friends at first and then they started telling friends that they knew and it kind of turned into me just trying to support people who were trying to improve their lives through the use of psilocybin.

In 2011, I started to really realize or feel strongly that psilocybin was not being given the respect it was due. Ayahuasca was getting all this attention as this great healing psychedelic and I knew psilocybin had all that same potential. So in 2011, it just occurred to me, I had been traveling to Jamaica for about 10 years at that point, and psilocybin was unregulated there. So it just kind of started to occur to me that ‘Hey, you can do this, you can help psilocybin get the respect that it deserves through retreats.’ So in 2011, I decided I was going to do these retreats. I spent the whole year of 2012 taking pretty big doses myself. I did a regimen during 2012 of every new moon and full moon taking 5 to 10 grams by myself out in the wilderness on my property. By 2013, I started to feel confident and competent to lead people through these experiences en masse. In November 2013, I led the first beta MycoMeditations retreat down there [in Jamaica]. It was small, just five people. But it went pretty well.

So, I had the mushroom farm in the states, which wasn’t making much money. I was selling psilocybin mushrooms to support the farm. And the [MycoMeditation] retreats in Jamaica, I never felt like I could be public about them because of the amount of psilocybin I was growing in the U.S. So I just kind of tried to get those going through a word of mouth kind thing  all the while wanting to get out of black market psilocybin mushrooms. It was never anything that I really wanted to do. 

magic mushroom church 

Then in 2015, someone reported me and I was arrested. It was actually someone that I did a mushroom session for. They got into some trouble and they pointed the finger at me. My wife and I were both arrested and put on house arrest for 8 weeks. They forced us to be separate since we were considered co-defendants. So we were separated for a good while there. Then after all that was resolved I ended up getting kicked off the farm because I was leasing it. So I lost my mushroom farm, moved back to Kentucky where I am from, and started trying to find a way to really get the retreats in Jamaica up and running.  

In February 2016, I had two guests that came down on retreat who ended up donating a total of $30,000 to me for salary so that I could quit my day job and focus solely on my retreats. That is really what allowed me to grow that project.

All along, I had understood psilocybin as a spiritual growth tool. Because of Michael Pollan’s work [How to Change Your Mind] and the Johns Hopkins’ research, everything was focused on psychology and depression and all that and my understanding back then and now still is that it’s not just a neurochemical outcome. There is a deeper healing that occurs that allows us to really experience more fully what it means to be human. So I went on with MycoMeditations and ran those retreats until 2020 and then kind of decided it was time to go back to my roots really.

The retreats in Jamaica, I very much loved doing that work but I never felt like I was really fully able to express my understanding of psilocybin. This is 23 years now that I have been taking mushrooms regularly. So in 2020, I got out of the retreats in Jamaica to focus more on the spiritual side rather than the scientific side of psilocybin and we came back here, my wife and I, and the administrative assistant who was a part of Mycomeditations, she grew up as a church organizer so this just felt like the right thing for her, too. And it’s how she understands psilocybin too: it’s a sacrament, not just a medicine. I can’t say that it’s not a medicine but again, just my understanding and experience of it is that it’s a medicine that’s working on our spiritual, energetic body as much as it is working on our physical, neurochemical selves.”

#### As you explore the magic mushroom church model, what image or message are you looking to put forward with Psanctuary?

“That’s one of the things that we are really diligent about exemplifying. Conscientious, responsible, mature…We really want to try to do our best to encourage only those types of organizations to follow suit because irresponsible leadership in psychedelics, whether it’s a clinical setting or a religious setting, is detrimental to the entire movement.”

#### How do you operate a magic mushroom church without fear of law enforcement intervention?

“I wouldn’t say that we operate without fear of law enforcement getting involved but I would say that our establishment through a pretty solid team of attorneys helps us feel a whole lot more confident. We have at least one advisor who has been an advisor to the DEA who helps us understand storage requirements and transportation requirements and all that. We spent about six months with three different attorneys setting up all the bylaws, all the infrastructure. Basically, once you file as a religious organization and get your paperwork and you’re recognized by the federal government as a religious organization, it’s on you to follow the best practices and to ensure that you meet the guidelines.”

#### In a nutshell, what is the legal precedent or verbiage that allows Psanctuary and other magic mushroom churches to operate?

If the existence of a church hinges on the use of a single sacrament and the permission or allowance of that sacraments’ use is the least obstructive means for the federal government to ensure the safety of those church members, then they have to keep their hands off of it.”

#### Do you know of any other magic mushroom church in the U.S. or abroad devoted only to psilocybin mushrooms as its sacrament?

“I don’t know of anybody that is just working with psilocybin. I have seen several churches that are cannabis and psilocybin or psilocybin and ayahuasca, this or that, but I don’t know of anybody that publicly or privately is just psilocybin other than us right now.”

#### I saw on your website that you have to apply to become a member of Psanctuary. What does that vetting process look like?

“It’s not extremely extensive but we want to know a general intention and a little bit about mental health. You don’t have to take the mushrooms to be a member of our church. We have quite a few people who are just considering the possibility of working with the mushroom that have never yet and they just want to be part of the community to understand how it is being applied in this manner. But it is a pretty simple process: just a brief application to kind of give us an idea of where you are coming from and why you are coming to us.”

#### From what I understand, once you are a member you have the opportunity to consume magic mushrooms, what you call your “sacramental service,” under the guidance of a Psanctuary-sanctioned cleric/moderator. What does that look like?

“Anytime we do a sacramental service, it is a three day event that includes four weeks of coaching, so two weeks of preparation and two weeks of integration afterwards. We offer up to an eight-week coaching program that is pretty involved. My background is in education. That is really what I have always considered myself in this world, is just educating people how to use the mushrooms for their own personal growth.”

Osborne then explained the three-day sacramental service as typically occurring on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. They only allow around five or six members to engage with the sacrament in a service. Members usually arrive on Friday afternoon, meet each other and prepare, commune with the mushrooms on Saturday under the guidance of the moderator and with one sitter for every two members ingesting the sacrament, and then have their weekly Sunday service on Sunday morning before leaving for their respective homes.

Aside from the “sacramental services,” the church also hosts a weekly, 90-minute Zoom call every Sunday combining inspirational readings and aspects characteristic of an integration circle. 

 

#### How do you decide on the proper dosage for each member taking part in these sacramental services?

“I want to make sure that people are able to have a powerful enough experience that it is transformative but at the same time I want to make sure that things don’t get too out of hand. One of the things that is an element of that is continuing to work with people who I have worked with over a long period of time, so knowing how individuals respond individually.

For those I’m new to working with, I just take it a little slow and help them understand that even if they don’t have a massive experience, they still are going to get an enormous amount of benefit out of it, especially with the coaching and if they are willing to put in the work to really explore what they came across. Personally, one of the realizations that I’ve come to in the last several years is that bigger is not always better when it comes to working with the mushroom.”

#### You mentioned that coaching program and on your site, I see mention of “More than Integration.” Tell me about More than Integration and your view of integration generally.

“More than Integration (MTI) is basically considered an extension of the Psanctuary ministry and MTI is that coaching program that is a part of the sacramental services. So when people sign up for a weekend with us, that’s actually what, aside from the lodging, accommodations, and food, that is what they are paying for: the coaching program.

That arose out of my experience in Jamaica because we had onsite integration and follow up integration afterwards but I never really felt like this kind of typical integration where you just kind of recall your experiences and try to understand what your experiences meant, I never really felt like that was enough. I still don’t. I feel like what people really need is an ongoing community. I am still very much integrating my first experience when I was 19 years old.

So to put together an intentional community that provides support, provides tools, provides ongoing, continuing education opportunities for people to gain more insight into their experiences as they have additional openings of their heart and mind is really what the name is trying to imply. Psychedelic growth requires more than just this standard concept of integration. It really requires a lifestyle change, an immersion in a community that can support you for years if need be.”

#### What kind of people are members of Psanctuary? Where are they from? What’s their background?

“We’ve got people from Norway coming in, we’ve got people from Jamaica that I’ve worked with down there, we’ve got people from the UK already coming into this on the zoom calls. It’s really exciting to just see this building as a community of support and shared perspective.

I think there’s a lot of people out there who are, while everybody respects the clinical and research models that are ongoing and all of that, but there are a whole lot of people out there that really look at this from a much more personal perspective. It’s not just a medicine. This is not just a science-based experience. This is something we cannot put words to. This is a mystical experience and the science supports that the mystical experience, the mystical aspect of the psilocybin experience, is elemental to the healing that comes out of it.”

#### How old is Psanctuary? How has it been going thus far? 

“We are actually only 19 weeks into our organization’s official start so considering we’re only 19 weeks in, we’ve already got 100+ members, I feel like we are doing pretty good. I am a pretty ambitious person though so I want some of these other projects in place ASAP. There’s a whole lot more that we have planned but right now we are just trying to really lay a solid groundwork.

The Sunday services are excellent at building that community and spreading the community out. I am very hopeful that in time Psanctuary will have locations around the country, possibly in other countries, who knows? And the Sunday calls are a great way to get that ball rolling and build the little smaller communities here and there. It’s hard for things to move as fast as I would like them to but when I actually take a step back and look at it, we’re doing pretty good for where we are considering that there’s only three of us that are really running the organization.”

> "We trust the medicine. We trust the sacrament. We trust the primacy and intelligence of the mushroom and the best thing that we can do usually is to stay the f**k out of the way.” 
> 
> Eric Osborne

#### When I read your website, it sounds as though your approach is more akin to sitting than to guiding. Do you agree with that assertion?

“Absolutely, 100%. We trust the medicine. We trust the sacrament. We trust the primacy and intelligence of the mushroom and the best thing that we can do usually is to stay the f**k out of the way.”

#### What does the religious model of operating a magic mushroom church allow for that the other models don’t? Put another way, what are the unique opportunities or benefits the religious model offers that you don’t see the other models possessing?

“Personally, it allows me to feel more comfortable expressing my authentic relationship with the mushroom. This allows me to really from the start, as someone who has been working with mushrooms for 23 years, allows me from the first time I sit down with somebody, to talk with them in the most authentic way possible. That’s the only aspect of inauthenticity that I ever felt I brought into the space in Jamaica. It just became apparent that I could no longer strictly work in what I consider still to be a pretty dry and even kind of egotistical manner.

I love the science. Science is what got me into mushrooms. But it only goes so far. And I feel like both typical religion and typical science have this very egotistical ‘we know the answer’ kind of perspective and I call bullshit. We don’t know. And that’s the perspective that I always try to take from the beginning when I’m working with somebody is that I don’t know what’s going on. I don’t know. I am doing my best to try to put the pieces together just like you. I get new information all the time that maybe gives me a broader perspective. But the truth is we’re never going to fully know what’s going on with reality and the human experience while we are in this limited physical capacity.”

 

#### How do you make sure you reduce the potential for harm as much as possible?

“There are two elements to assuring harm reduction outside of the dosing and setting and the mindset going into it. One is to stay out of the way of the mushroom. Once you start to interfere with someone’s experience, and I don’t think enough practitioners really understand this and I think particularly in the clinical setting it’s not really understood well enough, but once you start to interfere or interject yourself into someone else’s experience, you are introducing variables that can bring about outcomes that you are not ready to deal with.

The other crucial element that I truly believe is the most important aspect of harm reduction when you are working with people under the influence of psychedelics is your own personal level of experience. If people know that you are inauthentic, that you are insincere, that you are not there for them, but you are there to somehow boost your own ego or to try to play hero, that will be known. I have seen it cause serious upset and I have seen facilitators who put their intentions and their ego before the people that they are working with, or who came to the space with a lot of their own very dark stuff that they had not worked through. That will cause some real problems. If you have somebody who is on a large dose of psilocybin and they are freaking out, if you tell that they are going to be okay but you don’t trust that they are going to be okay, they are going to know that and it is going to escalate the situation so much more rapidly.

The subtleties that go into this space, the subtleties that contribute to safety are not talked about enough. There’s a lot of talk about eyeshades and music and methods of control but in my experience, my sincere belief is that the most effective safeguard that we can bring into this space is our own authenticity and our own ability to look at our shit, to have real tough experiences with the mushroom so that people know that they are working with someone who…maybe I’ve never experienced what you are experiencing per se, but I have died a thousand times on mushrooms, I’ve had at least 500 doses of psilocybin myself and so many of those have been just excruciating. So people know when you look at them and you say to them ‘I get it.’ When they are in that state of high perception and real vulnerability, they know if you are telling the truth or if you are just bullshitting them and if you are bullshitting them it’s going to set off so many alarms.”

#### Personally, why do you engage in this work?

“I could say that it’s about the healing of the individual but what I have really learned from working with the mushroom is that whenever one of us sets on a healing path, whenever one of us experiences some kind of exponential growth, we are not figuratively, we are literally doing that for the collective of humanity.

I have worked with some very challenging situations and most of those people were just regular folks who had been building up a lifetime of unprocessed trauma. It just really is important to me that people know that they are supported, they know that we are here to be of service to them so that they can grow and be the best that they can be so when they go back to their homes and their communities, they can take that there and help their communities be better.”

I have seen processing take place that provided relief for people seemingly completely unassociated with the event. I know that it sounds flaky to a lot of people but I know that beyond a doubt that every time somebody eats mushrooms in a safe, cared for manner where healing is allowed to occur, that they are helping to heal every human being on this planet. We truly are one. That is not a metaphor.”

#### What does success look like to you and Psanctuary? What’s Psanctuary look like in 5 years, ideally?

“Success looks like a growing community of compassion and authenticity. It’s pretty simple. They [psilocybin mushrooms] are a tool for processing but as we process this kind of stagnant information, then we become more authentic and if there is anything that will really help to heal humanity, it’s if we put down all these fucking masks, and all this bullshit baggage of ‘I’m this group’ or ‘I’m this person’ and we just really get back to the basics that we are just humans and we don’t even know what that is. Through that we can learn to love each other and love the moment a little bit more and the closer we get to that, that’s what I call success. Success is not an end result. Success is an ongoing effort.”

#### Before we close, I want to hand you the mic. Is there any other message you want to offer?

“It’s really important to advise caution. It can look a lot simpler than it is. I know there are a lot of people who are thinking ‘Maybe I should start a church.’ I’m not saying that you shouldn’t but I’m not saying you should. People don’t see the 23 years of experience that has gone into this thing right here right now and that is really important to consider because this is not a fucking play thing. I also just really want to make sure people are smart for their own safety and for the ongoing growth of this work so that more people can get access to the healing of these mushrooms.”

I’m interested in growing a variety of mushrooms on my 93 acre hillside farm, bounded by 2 streams and a plethora of trees.  
I also was born in Marion Co Ky, raised in Lex. though reside on the farm in Washington Co Ky.  
Additionally, I’m quite interested in the Psanctuary Church and have partaken in the sacrament a # of times, though not in the past 30 years. Albeit, I’m always willing to learn and grow spiritually!  
Also have a background in education and the mental health field, MAED with emphasis in Community Health.

I am in Oregon. My limited experience with psilocybin mushrooms stems from Liberty Caps forty years ago as a young woman. In my senior years I am feeling drawn to mushrooms again to realize my highest self, heal myself, and be of service to others along their path.  
I look to be immersed in a loving community, support the mushroom culture that will surely explode in the coming period and in 2023 with legalization.

Fantastic. I would love to join. I hope there are local churches coming soon. I am somewhat surprised that the DEA is not doing everything they can to shut you down, however. They took their fight against the UDV ayahuasca church all the way to the Supreme Court — where they lost, incredibly enough, 9 to 0. This is one of the best ways to combat the drug war, to show that naturally occurring medicine is so far from being devil spawn that it is used in church rituals.

Way to go Eric…stay out of the way. The innate intelligence/motives of the sacrament know how to work its ways on us… if we ‘stay out of the way’ – a notion that sometimes isnt always though of received well… in my experience. Good to have legit guidance for newcomers as you can ‘to the chase’ send folks on a ‘better-more meaningful’ path rather than ‘figuring it out’ on your own and process/integrate for years…. Much too slow. Stay real. Hope to cross paths in the future.  
Peace

Elon Musk denies knowledge of a $400 million 'Armored' Tesla deal with the Trump Administration

One Hope of Colorado, a network of affiliated church groups, has launched an initiative to purchase its main chapel in Fort Collins, built in 1897, using blockchain technology. The group has tokenized the “Old Stone Church,” a historic 11,457-square-foot building, to raise $2.5 million for its ownership.

While this may sound new, as it will be the first church ever to be tokenized, it is not new for the blockchain world to tokenize real-world assets. In simple terms, the tokenization of funds is the process of converting real-world assets (RWAs) or funds into digital tokens using blockchain technology. Real-world assets encompass tangible assets like real estate, intellectual properties, art, currencies, commodities, equities, bonds, money markets, and more.

Advertisement 

Pastor Blake Bush led the initiative, believing this innovative approach was divinely inspired.

“I heard the Lord say, ‘tokenize the building,’” Bush told Forbes. He further added that he had been “praying for this for years” and that God had told him to “go get my house.”

## Why is the church tokenizing itself?

Bush’s congregation and other church groups had been renting the Old Stone Church from its current owner, a local businessperson who also owns a car dealership. The building was purchased in 2022 for $2.2 million. Bush and the Colorado House of Prayer now plan to buy it for $2.5 million. To achieve this, Bush partnered with REtokens, a company specializing in the tokenization of real estate assets, to tokenize the building using the Polymesh blockchain.

One Hope of Colorado aims to pioneer a new model for community investment through real-world asset tokenization, selling shares to the community to raise funds. The goal is to secure enough capital to purchase the Old Stone Church within three years, preserving the historic building. In its initial phase, One Hope intends to raise $2.5 million from accredited investors within the first year. These investors will hold the tokens for a year before selling them on a secondary market, primarily to Colorado residents. 

Graeme Moore, Head of Tokenization at Polymesh Association, stated that real estate is undergoing a transformation through real-world asset tokenization.

“One Hope of Colorado, as the first-ever tokenized church, is a great example of unlocking liquidity and fostering collaborative ownership,” he said in a press release.

Pastor Bush and his group have created “Stone Coin,” a digital asset designed to raise funds for purchasing the Old Stone Church. As with any tokenization project, its success will rely on the level of positive token flow and market response.

Technology has profoundly affected church history and continues to affect our daily lives, transforming the way that we interact, work, and share our faith. Few technologies have been as revolutionary as the internet, which, like any other major technological advancement, changes over time and develops through phases. We are now entering what many perceive as a new phase of the internet, often called web3. It has a common motto of “read, write, own.” In the first phase of the internet (web1), you could simply visit websites and read them. In the second phase (web2), you could also add your own content, such as posting pictures or writing reviews, but you didn’t really own that content. The content you created was controlled by big companies such as Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and YouTube, which could censor or control what you posted. In this third phase (web3), proponents anticipate that you will be able to truly own what you create, allowing for an internet that is more democratic, private, and secure.

What underlies this new era of digital ownership is blockchain technology. What is blockchain? It’s really just a modern twist on the ancient practice of keeping records. Accounting began in ancient Mesopotamia, where the first accountants etched marks onto clay tablets, each line signifying a transaction. This sort of “single-entry” bookkeeping held sway for centuries, until “double-entry” bookkeeping came along during the fifteenth-century Renaissance. Double-entry bookkeeping revolutionized accounting by instituting a dual-column system of debits and credits. This method of recording things twice brought accuracy, consistency, and reliability to accounting practices, and our banks still use a variation of this system today. Double-entry bookkeeping, however, still depends on humans and institutions, so it can be prone to data alteration, lack of transparency, human error, and fraud.

Blockchain technology represents what seems to be a new method of keeping accounts, or bookkeeping. It introduces a third component to double-entry bookkeeping: a cryptographically secure digital receipt. Some have called blockchain “triple-entry” bookkeeping. Transactions continue to be recorded twice, but an innovative third entry is now included in a shared public ledger and is given a unique, tamper-proof digital signature through automated computer code. A trusted third party, such as an accountant or institution, is no longer needed because the code automatically verifies the transactions. The ledger is immutable, so it can’t be altered or deleted, thereby strengthening the transaction’s integrity. Picture this as like a public bulletin board, where new notices can be added but existing ones cannot be altered or removed.

Few technologies have been as revolutionary as the internet, which, like any other major technological advancement, changes over time and develops through phases.

Share

The internet, as it exists now, consists primarily of many companies that keep accounts, or ledgers, of what we’ve posted, what emails we’ve sent or received, or what money we have in our bank accounts. These companies are often large corporations, such as Google, Facebook, X, Amazon, Apple, and Chase. We depend on these organizations’ goodwill for access to our digital property. With blockchain technology, it’s possible that in the future, internet users won’t depend on any individual organization for access to and management of their property. Rather, what one owns on the internet will be immutably recorded on the blockchain, so no large corporation—or anyone, for that matter—will be able to take your digital property away from you. Many refer to this idea as decentralization, because blockchain decentralizes bookkeeping authority. This technology, therefore, has the potential to be truly revolutionary, overturning business models, changing corporations, and enabling new means of engagement on the internet that aren’t so controlled by third parties.

Given this potential for change, how can Christians anticipate the future? What benefits and dangers might Christians need to consider in thinking about the future of the internet? Here are a few:

Free Speech. The right to free speech is often regarded as the right upon which all other rights are built. It encompasses our ability to share the faith openly without fear of persecution or censorship. Web3 consists of decentralized applications that run on the blockchain. The use of these independent protocols could represent both a danger and an opportunity for free speech, since we will perhaps no longer be at the mercy of tech or media companies that determine what’s appropriate to say. While it’s possible that with no filter whatsoever, free speech will descend into a chaos of noise, at the same time, undiluted gospel proclamation could benefit.

Constraint. The adoption of blockchain has the potential for harmful constraint, most notably the prospect of heightened regulation. For instance, nations can develop Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) to assert tighter control over their currencies. China’s release of the digital yuan, which allows it to control, track, manipulate, and potentially block all transactions within its borders, is a case in point. Blockchain’s versatility, however, also enables the removal of constraints on fund transfers and international communication, since digital currencies aren’t inherently subject to central government control, with Bitcoin being one example. While this can inadvertently facilitate illegal activities, it also signifies that Christians’ finances perhaps wouldn’t be easily subjected to the whims of corporations with sinful agendas or oppressive political regimes. It could also make it easier to support missionaries and ministries in countries that are hostile to Christianity. Thus, blockchain could potentially offer Christians greater freedom, support, and encouragement, particularly in nations where gospel proclamation is suppressed.

Trust. The recent boom in AI technologies poses a risk for truth and trust in many ways because they can often convincingly imitate people and institutions. To combat this, blockchain could serve as the standard of origin for original content. For example, bad actors might maliciously create or distort a piece of content, such as an article or a video, but content posted on a blockchain is unalterable and can prove where a work came from, almost like a watermark. Blockchain could provide a “proof of truth” or “proof of originality” through a ledger of public, immutable, and permanent content ownership and authenticity.

Privacy. Unlike the current internet, where YouTube, Facebook, PayPal, and other organizations often require you to share personal details before using their services, decentralized apps don’t necessarily require users to provide personal data to access services and content or to make transactions. This enables anonymous usage. While anonymity can provide a cover for unhealthy and sinful engagement on the internet, Christians living under authoritarian regimes could leverage this anonymity to freely access gospel resources and donate to ministries without facing political persecution. By removing the need for identity verification, believers in oppressive contexts could engage in and contribute to global ministry efforts with minimized risk.

* * *



Distribution. What if we could distribute Christian content around the world instantly, without political repercussions, and practically for free? One of the most attractive features for Christian missions and education is the capability within these technologies for seamless mass distribution of content around the world. Through decentralized networks, content creators could perhaps directly reach global audiences, bypassing geographical and political limitations.

Connection. Paul’s exhortation to the Thessalonians to “encourage one another and build one another up” (1 Thess. 5:11) is an ever-standing call to strengthen our Christian communities. Web3 could help the church in its effort to gather and grow together. While God’s people are called to gather physically in local churches primarily, there is also an opportunity to use technology to further the spread of the gospel and discipleship resources to Christians and churches worldwide. Christians, ministries, and churches do not currently own the platforms where Christian communities gather digitally, such as Facebook, X, Instagram, and YouTube. Because we don’t own these platforms, our communities can be censored at any moment or taken away without notice. Through web3 ownership, communities could perhaps be freer and more autonomous.

For all its perceived complexity and novelty, the decentralized web offers the global church benefits worth considering, although dangers certainly lurk in the background. To consider web3 and its potential does not represent an endorsement of blindly adopting all its aspects; rather, it’s a call to equip ourselves with knowledge of our times and of what the future could possibly hold, to apply our faith in discerning what aligns with our values, and to engage wisely with the world. As Christians, we draw comfort from knowing that God is ultimately in control, and we can find solace in the truth that Jesus is the supreme authority over all powers (Col. 2:9–10).

##### what now?

We find ourselves on the cusp of a new digital age, one in which we are being presented with a remarkable opportunity to thoughtfully engage with these emerging developments—much as our forefathers did in their times. Approaching this journey with proper wisdom and discernment, we should strive to carry the gospel to people where they are (1 Cor. 9:19–23), remembering how church history stands as a faithful proof that the people of God effectively harnessed technology for the furtherance of the good news of Christ and the strengthening of the global church.

At the outset of such a daunting task, let us not lose heart as we navigate the challenges. Dr. Sinclair Ferguson was recently reflecting on Isaiah’s prophecy in 49:6: “I will make you as a light for the nations, that my salvation may reach to the end of the earth.” He said: “We’re living in days when this prophecy is being fulfilled [and] that’s true despite all the doom and gloom we hear. . . . It’s true we haven’t yet fully fulfilled the Great Commission, and the church often fails, but God’s promise to His Son that He will give Him the nations for His inheritance has not failed, and it will not fail.” As we engage with this new digital landscape, let us do so with discernment, seeking to use technology for the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ and the expansion of His kingdom.

A church group in Colorado, known as the Colorado House of Prayer, has turned to blockchain technology to buy a chapel worth $2.5 million.

Under the leadership of Pastor Blake Bush, the group has tokenized the building, converting it into a digital asset to make the purchase process easier.

The chapel, called the Old Stone Church, is an 11,457-square-foot building that the group has been renting. The current owner, a businessperson who also runs a car dealership, bought the building in 2022 for $2.2 million.

Pastor Bush told Forbes that the decision to use blockchain was inspired by a spiritual experience, describing:

> I heard the Lord say, "tokenize the building."

To raise the needed funds, the group created a digital currency called "Stone Coin." This token, backed by real estate, runs on the Polymesh private blockchain.

The project's success depends on attracting enough investments and maintaining the value of the tokens. Having raised about half their goal, they're now looking for more investors, including those beyond their religious community.

Opening token sales to non-members has sparked concerns about outsiders gaining control over the asset. However, when asked about the possibility of groups with opposing beliefs, like Satanists, buying tokens, Bush replied:

> Let's introduce you to Jesus.

The Colorado House of Prayer's decision to tokenize the chapel shows how modern technology can be used to achieve spiritual goals.

In other news, in June, Galaxy Digital and the co-founder of Animoca Brands tokenized a 1708 Stradivarius Violin.

In a field of yellow wildflowers at a large metropolitan park on a perfect spring Sunday afternoon, a small Louisville church congregation was sitting on blankets, about to microdose psilocybin mushrooms.

Anyone could have been forgiven for thinking that this group was one of the others that populated the area that day — the yoga class, perhaps, or the people playing fetch with their dogs. Nothing immediately gave away their purpose, though from a distance, onlookers would miss the hints — the neon mushroom-themed blanket on which two church founders sat, the references to “the mushroom space” dotting the conversation throughout the afternoon.

This church was Psanctuary: The Sacred Mushroom Church, a religious organization in Louisville that uses psilocybin mushrooms, which have psychedelic properties, in their religious practices and regards them as a tool for communing with a higher power and nature. Like in most of the country, psilocybin mushrooms are illegal in Kentucky. The “sacred mushrooms,” as the church often calls them, are a Schedule I controlled substance that can carry a punishment of up to three years for possession, but registered 508(c)(1)(a) churches like Psanctuary have certain legal protections they say allow them to use mushrooms in controlled worship contexts. This afternoon’s gathering, their fourth of its kind since the church’s inception in 2021, was, in their phrasing, a “subtle sacrament encounter” — less than a full trip experience (a “congregational communion”), but a communion with the world nonetheless, by way of mushrooms. 

First, though, the congregants shared their intentions for the day — “to be me,” “to find myself again,” to be a good representation for the church — as well as what they were grateful for. A young Psanctuary cleric in training, Tristan Harris, said he was looking forward to the chance to “connect with you all and with this” — he patted the earth — “big ball.”

Psanctuary’s founder and minister, 43-year-old Eric Osborne, pulled a small Pyrex container out of a tote bag. Inside it was a collection of small psilocybin mushroom caps, tiny things, each one 0.10 grams and barely bigger than a fingertip. 

A “sacred mushroom,” Eric told the group, “is just a gift of nature,” one you “don’t even have to grow” — “just got to pick ‘em and there they are.”

“Heaven’s right here,” he said, “if we allow it to be.”

His wife Courtney McClure, Psanctuary’s secretary and co-founder, had already passed around a clipboard with a waiver, which all nine people in the circle (except me) had signed. The group was a small fraction of the approximately 30 local members and the 120 or so internationally who make up the church — technically, the “non-denominational, international faith-based community.”

Eric distributed the mushroom caps, and, together, each group member popped theirs into their mouth in an instant. A few winced at the taste.

Once everyone had eaten their cap, Courtney read the church’s statement of faith:

“We believe that Sacred Mushrooms are a primary source of personal and divine revelation. We seek counsel from the mushroom, to find direction and inspiration in our faith practice. And we believe that all individuals who seek true revelation from Divinity can do so.”

Psanctuary uses psilocybin mushrooms the way they do because they’re a registered 508(c)(1)(A) organization, and the Kentucky Religious Freedom Restoration Act prohibits the government from “substantially burden[ing] a person’s exercise of religion.” That’d be true if they were a “normal” church, too, but their exercise of religion involves something most churches, to put it mildly, would likely frown upon. 

Still, Psanctuary’s exercise of religion is about connecting people to mushrooms in a way that goes beyond a list of thou-shalt-nots. 

“We want to change the culture around religious experiences and psychedelic experiences,” Eric told LEO. “I’m not against recreational psychedelics, but that’s not how they’re best applied. If you really believe, like we do, that these mushrooms are a sacrament that can connect you to your higher power, then they should be used intentionally.” 

#### Going To Church 

There were nine of us that afternoon (plus two dogs), and we sat on blankets in groups of two and three. Eric and Courtney shared one that was decorated with designs of psychedelically colored mushrooms, a gift from a therapist who’d worked with their former upscale wellness retreat business in Jamaica, MycoMeditations. Their dog Smokey lay in the grass in front of them.

Young husband and wife Tristan and Cassie Harris sat on a pink blanket with their dog Luna, who often trotted away from the group throughout the afternoon, prompting one of them to follow after her. Tristan, the aforementioned Psanctuary cleric in training, hails from Pike County. After he finishes the eight-week training process, he’ll be able to help Eric (and/or Psanctuary’s two ministers in training) officiate sacrament experiences while getting paid for it. (Other church members will be able to train as ministers in a 10-month program starting on May 25.)

I shared a green blanket with Alex, a tall, gentle-voiced guy who asked that LEO not share his last name. I was the only one present who had never tried psychedelics of any sort; my closest foray into that world was one incredibly underwhelming experience smoking weed in California. 

Psanctuary co-founder and treasurer Athena Short joined an older couple, Stephen and Nancy Headland, on a white blanket across from Eric and Courtney.

Unlike everyone else in the group that day, the Headlands, two founding members of Psanctuary’s congregation, do not live in Kentucky — yet. They hail from Paso Robles, a sunny, semi-rural town in California’s wine country. They’re so new, in fact, that a reference to planning an event around Thunder Over Louisville confused them: “I thought you had the ability to predict actual thunder in the sky!” laughed Nancy.

They were in Louisville for the week for a “fact-finding mission” — looking at neighborhoods, scouting out potential places to live. So far, so good: they’d loved the welcoming and diverse locals and had not “met anybody who was cross or even looked cross; everybody’s been super friendly,” Nancy said. They’re looking forward to having four weather seasons, even thunderstorms, and to making use of the city’s sizable park system. Their plan is to be here in August — around the one-year anniversary of them joining Psanctuary.

In fact, they’re moving to Louisville because of Psanctuary.

Nancy and Stephen Headland share their experiences with mushrooms with other members of Psanctuary.

Stephen and Nancy had both met Eric and had had experiences with mushrooms before joining the church; after they’d each attended a MycoMeditations retreat a few years ago (albeit not at the same time), they’d come back to the U.S. feeling transformed, “lighter,” with an impetus to make huge changes in their lives.

“While not a panacea and not a magic bullet,” said Stephen, who has given up all drinking and smoking since his retreat experience, psilocybin mushrooms “really awakened in me the idea that things could be different — things could change.”

They continued to keep up with Eric through his podcasts, “Psilocybin Says” and “The Psilocybin Chronicles,” and joined the church last year; they’re the first non-founding members whose faces you see in Psanctuary’s promotional video, which was filmed at the church’s retreat in Brandenburg last September. Now, they’re looking forward to being part of its in-person community and further exploring their relationship to psilocybin.

“Each time I commune with the mushroom, I get something out of it,” Stephen told LEO. “Sometimes it’s a little something. Sometimes it’s a harsh something. Sometimes it’s a soft, warm something. But there’s always a lesson. I feel like the mushrooms are there to teach.”

#### How It Started, How It Works 

Psanctuary was founded in February 2021 and held its first Zoom service on May 2, 2021. By early September 2021, when their website went live, the church had already grown to nearly 100 members, which Eric commemorated in an Instagram post: “I suspect you will see this community expand rapidly as it is founded in love, compassion and honesty. Anything else is destined to fail.” (Incidentally, Psanctuary’s URL used to belong to a Christian church in England.) 

They finally got an in-person meeting space earlier this year.

On May 7, 2021, Psanctuary officially got its 508(c)(1)(A) status, making it a nonprofit religious organization. 

A 508(c)(1)(A) organization, in layman’s terms, is a church in the eyes of the law, but one that might not fit the mold of what attorney Greg Lake, a consultant and author who specializes in laws relating to entheogenic (psychedelic) religious groups like Psanctuary, calls a “picture-perfect orthodox church.” If Psanctuary — which is one of his clients — were to file as a 501(c)(3) church, the more traditional option, they’d essentially be “asking the IRS to comment on validity of [their] religion,” Lake said.

In any case, Lake said, the practice of using psychedelic substances spiritually has existed for millennia so Psanctuary is, in a sense, nothing new. About groups like Psanctuary, he told LEO, “You can’t regulate these things out of existence.”

Members of Psanctuary discuss their faith on a Sunday afternoon as part of a “subtle sacrament encounter,” an afternoon that involves hiking in a Louisville park and microdosing psilocybin mushrooms.

A 2002 article in the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies [MAPS] Bulletin, a journal published by the foremost authorities on psychedelic research, noted close to 40 churches and religious organizations in North America and Europe (many of which are now defunct, in part due to legal threats) that have centered their religious practices around cannabis, ayahuasca, peyote and, of course, psilocybin mushrooms. The landmark U.S. v. Boyll case in 1990 ensured that members of a Native American religious group that used peyote (even non-Native members like Boyll himself) were exempt from laws that criminalized the use of peyote because they did so in “bona fide religious ceremonies.”

Psanctuary says it exercises using mushrooms under the auspices of the Kentucky Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a successor to the original federal law passed by Bill Clinton in 1993 that was struck down in 1997. It reads: 

“Government shall not substantially burden a person’s freedom of religion. The right to act or refuse to act in a manner motivated by a sincerely held religious belief may not be substantially burdened unless the government proves by clear and convincing evidence that it has a compelling governmental interest in infringing the specific act or refusal to act and has used the least restrictive means to further that interest. A ‘burden’ shall include indirect burdens such as withholding benefits, assessing penalties, or an exclusion from programs or access to facilities.”

Gov. Steve Beshear vetoed the bill in 2013, citing concerns that it would “cause serious unintentional consequences that could threaten public safety, health care and individuals’ civil rights,” according to a statement at the time, but a Republican-majority General Assembly overrode his veto. In various states, laws like this one have been used in cases about LGBT discrimination and vaccine mandates, among other issues, but they have, in general, been a boon for members of psychedelic churches. 

But, as Eric told me: “We are practicing our sincere faith. And until someone can prove to us that it is insincere and that we are putting the public at risk, then we’re going to keep on practicing our faith.”

#### ‘Intense And Intentional’

People who think Psanctuary is solely about eating psychedelic mushrooms will be sorely disappointed. Much of the “work” of being in the church is about talking with fellow congregants.

Of course, Psanctuary’s ministry is chiefly focused on psilocybin mushrooms and their benefits. Even their logo is a stylization of the underside of a mushroom cap, with the mushroom’s gills radiating out from what appears to be an eye in the middle. 

Likewise, Psanctuary has their semantic particularities. Psilocybin mushrooms themselves are often referred to singularly as “the mushroom” or “the sacrament,” variably with or without capitalization, or sometimes “sacred mushrooms.” Eating mushrooms is “partaking in the sacrament.” A trip itself is a “sacrament experience”; microdosing is a “subtle sacrament experience.” A bad trip is a “challenging experience.” One’s headspace during a trip is “the mushroom space.” A group trip is “congregational communion.” Their name, of course, is “Psanctuary,” spelled with a P like in “psychedelic” and “psilocybin,” and their twice-monthly meetings are known as “Psacred Circles.” Sunday services and some emails end with the send-off “Mush love.”

Still, the “trip” experiences — both the subtle sacrament encounters like the one last Sunday and their multi-day retreats — are only a fraction of their overall ministry, and they’re members-only at that. To become one, you have to pay a nonrefundable one-time fee of $35, then choose your monthly giving tier — $10, $20 or $30, plus a $0.50, $1 or $1.50 processing fee, respectively. (It’s a sliding scale system; all tiers have the same benefits.) After that, you fill out an application, then sign their code of ethics and liability waiver. Once that’s done, you schedule a call with the founders to talk about the church and your intentions with joining. Members have access to the congregation’s Telegram channel and Discord server.

As you might expect, they’ve had to turn away people who’ve come to the church only for an easy supply of mushrooms. Those people, Eric said, will “pretty quickly exit themselves out” after hearing the in-depth and personal conversations that Psanctuary members have at their in-person and virtual gatherings.

“Because we are so sincere, we are so intense and intentional behind what we’re doing, if that’s not what you’re into, then you’re gonna go find somewhere else to do drugs. That’s easy,” he told LEO. Anybody can find someone to do mushrooms with, he added, but “not just anybody can come and sit and have a two-hour conversation about their own real personal vulnerabilities or pain and trauma.”

Those two-hour events — bi-monthly Psacred Circles in person and weekly Sunday Services on Zoom — make up the bulk of the church’s programming, though their recent and upcoming events also include mindfulness sessions, a cacao ceremony and a silent disco vendor’s market. 

Their in-person events take place inside a cozy studio space on East Broadway, where the only thing immediately indicating its purpose is a string of decorative mushrooms right inside the entrance. Potted plants sit atop a cubby shelf; paintings by Eric — a poinsettia, some Van Gogh-esque plants — add color to one of the exposed brick walls. 

I went to both the Community Psacred Circle on Tuesday, March 29, led by Eric; and the Women’s Psacred Circle on Saturday, April 2, led by Courtney.

Eric’s circle was heavily mushroom-focused. There were 10 of us — all men, except for Athena and me — but our conversations focused more on mental health, trauma, organized religion and the pros and cons of using mushrooms for healing. Alex spoke heartfeltly about the concept of communion. 

At the women’s circle, Courtney asked us to keep anything personal that was shared inside the circle fully inside the circle, to which we all agreed. Still, I can say that it was slightly larger than the previous one — there were 14 of us, including one service dog, but we were all female. 

We didn’t talk about mushrooms, though — we talked about emotions. We did a “body scan meditation,” then played several rounds of “The Noticing Game,” where we shared observations about how we (collectively and individually) were feeling and existing in the space. It wasn’t always easy; I struggled to come up with a response on two of the four rounds, but it helped us connect as a group.

The word “Psanctuary” didn’t even come up until the very end, right before Courtney concluded the group and offered people slices of homemade hawthorn berry heart cake.

#### The Road To Psanctuary

The long journey to Psanctuary didn’t begin with a prayer to God or a cry for salvation or a Bible verse. It began with another walk in the woods. 

Eric was 19 in 1999, a student at St. Catharine College, a small, now-shuttered Catholic school near his hometown of Springfield, Kentucky, working on an associate degree in liberal studies. He’d graduated from a Catholic high school a few years earlier. 

By that point, though, he’d already started to question the faith he was brought up in.

“As I got older, I started to see that where I really felt in touch with God was not in the Church,” he said. “I mean, I was fully bought into the Catholic thing. When the pedophilia scandal broke out, by then, I’d already started to really question the validity of what I was engaged with all the time. But then I just said, ‘Look, this is hogwash. This is corrupt to its core.’”

Disillusionment with the Church led him to explore nature more — to spend more time in the woods, hiking and hunting for mushrooms, initially for food.

When he discovered psychedelic mushrooms, it was a revelation. Years of church experience had failed to give him a spiritual connection, yet here was something that could — something “real and direct” and “not a theoretical thing anymore.” 

Eric was already plenty familiar with the sacrament of communion, how, in the Catholic Church, through the process of transubstantiation, a thin wafer gets transformed by the priest into the body of Christ.

But a psychedelic mushroom — this did not need to be consecrated. To him, it was already holy and perfect by its own existence. It was a doorway to God, nature and the universe, and he could hold it between his fingertips.

Still, after he transferred to UofL and graduated in 2004, he taught English for a few years at a Catholic middle school in Louisville.

In 2009, he made a complete pivot: he started a mushroom farm, Magnificent Mushrooms, in rural Paoli, Indiana, about an hour northwest of downtown Louisville. He would have preferred to have stayed in Kentucky, he said, but a board member at his school had an empty farm and needed someone to maintain it, so the opportunity was there.

Eric turned the farm into a thriving business that grew close to 15 different varieties of mushrooms over the course of its time in Paoli. He grew 100-150 pounds of edible mushrooms a week for restaurants, private caterers and a grocery store in Louisville and Southern Indiana. Locally, his clients included Le Relais, Harvest (which has since closed) and the Wiltshire group. He led educational workshops about the benefits of mushrooms — both edible and psilocybin. In 2011, the Indiana State Department of Health recognized Eric as a wild mushroom identification expert.

On April 8, 2013, he met Courtney McClure, a former competitive figure skater who was then working at the Middletown branch of the local health food market Rainbow Blossom. They married in October 2016, and they now have four children between them, including two from Eric’s previous marriages.

In November 2013, Eric started leading trips to Jamaica — where psychedelics are legal — with MycoMeditations, the wellness retreat company he’d founded the year before. MycoMeditations, which specializes in high-end psilocybin-assisted retreats, offers guests guided mushroom trips and licensed therapists in an ocean-front environment in an attempt to combat depression, anxiety, PTSD and addiction.

But in June 2015, Courtney and Eric entered what he calls “the worst, hardest period of our lives” when police raided their 87-acre Magnificent Mushrooms farm in Indiana and took them away to jail.

Eric Osborne, right, and his wife Courtney McClure, left, are both co-founders of Psanctuary.

The Paoli Police Department said officers found five pounds of psilocybin mushrooms and seven pounds of cannabis butter on the property (though, Eric disputes this, claiming that officers included the weight of the dirt in the mushroom weight, and that there were “probably only three ounces” of weed in the butter).

Arrested on a slew of drug charges, Courtney was locked up for a day before getting bailed out while Eric was held in jail for eight days. After their release, they’d spend eight weeks on home incarceration. In the end, they were sentenced to two and a half years of probation.

They say the relatively lenient outcome was likely because they were both white and neither one had an arrest record.

“People’s lives are taken away every day because of plants,” Courtney said.

Despite the ordeal, Eric managed to give off a slight smile in his mugshot as he posed against the white cinderblock walls.

“I was doing my best to smile because this has always been my faith and practice. I have always had some kind of trust in the mushroom, and I trust the process,” he said. “Even though that was a horrifying day, there was still a part of me that knew everything was gonna work out, that still had that faith.”

In 2017, he and Courtney moved to Treasure Beach, Jamaica, to restart Magnificent Mushrooms and continue MycoMeditations.

Still, Eric said, he missed his home state. In Jamaica, he’d often play John Prine’s “My Old Kentucky Home, Goodnight,” and he even adopted a dog named Kentucky. (She’s still doing well, but she now lives on a hemp farm, where she has more room to run around that she needed than she had at Eric and Courtney’s house.)

Eric decided to leave Myco in late 2020; his replacement, Justin Townsend, is a former Myco facilitator who has since become CEO and head facilitator. (Currently, the cheapest option via MycoMeditations is a week-long “Classic Retreat” that starts at $4,300 per person for a double occupancy and $5,550 for single occupancy.)

Since then, Eric and Courtney started a podcast, “Psilocybin Says,” in April 2021; founded a psychedelic coaching business, More Than Integration in May 2021 and started Psanctuary the same month. 

Eric treasured his time in Treasure Beach, but now, he’s back in Louisville, continuing to share his beliefs about psilocybin mushrooms.

“I just love Kentucky,” he told LEO. “I want to help people heal here.”

#### Out Of The Woods 

Back in the park, I caught Alex staring up intently at a bare tree and went over to photograph the moment. He said he was appreciating the patterns of its branches and how new leaves were coming in; still, he shied away from a photo because he “can’t be natural now that I know there’s a camera.” I looked over at Athena, who was having fun on a nearby swing set. Tristan and Luna followed shortly after, and Cassie took photos of them on her phone. A few minutes later, Courtney took Tristan’s place. Both she and Athena were wearing flowers in their hair. They were giddy and happy and eventually tried to synchronize their swinging before they jumped off, which they asked me to photograph.

While this was happening, others in our group were chatting with parkgoers about the tribulations of using the grody bathrooms — this one doesn’t lock; that one has no toilet paper.

A realization struck me: those people have no idea that our group is microdosing.

It also struck me: any of them could be microdosing right now, too.

At that point, we’d been hiking around the park for about an hour, walking along the trails and admiring a broad expanse of flowers that spread out gorgeously under the trees. As we walked, at one point joyfully passing a turtle sunning itself on a rock, everybody was in good spirits. Stephen said the mushrooms were giving him a heightened appreciation for the nature that surrounded us — they were making the nice day feel like a “nice day squared.”

As we made our way down the pedestrian side of a long stretch of road, and I spotted our blankets through the trees, which lay like gigantic flower petals through the barren woods.

By the time we returned to the circle, it was already 3:45 p.m. The harsh earlier light had already mellowed; the shadows had softened. Courtney offered people some chocolate as she and others sat down, basking in the beautiful day. Eric walked around with Smokey; Tristan reclined on a fallen tree nearby.

Not long after, we all gathered together again. For two hours, as the sun continued to fall slowly behind the trees, we just talked — about psilocybin, dreams, mushroom hunting, palliative care, divinity, stigma, consciousness, past lives, infinity, ego deaths and relationships, amongst many other topics.

At one point, Eric relayed a story: a client who had debated whether or not he should work with Eric (and ultimately did so) went to a psychic about the matter. The psychic said that this was Eric’s “last incarnation” on Earth.

“I don’t buy it,” Eric said. “I wanna keep coming back.”

From left: Nancy Headland, Athena Short, and Cassie Harris relax after Psanctuary’s “subtle sacrament encounter” hike.

We concluded with a mindfulness meditation.

It was quiet and peaceful. Some sounds overlaid each other: soft piano music from Courtney’s Bluetooth speaker, which pulsed rainbow colors; mourning doves, cars, a slight breeze.

Nancy told the group she’d had a feeling of something right before the timer went off to end the meditation. When she opened her eyes, she was staring right at Luna, who stared directly back at her. 

We all laughed; Tristan congratulated his dog on being the “something” — “Good job, Luna.”

Before the circle dispersed into a round of standing hugs, Courtney asked us to remind ourselves of the intentions we’d shared hours before and consider if we’d achieved them during the afternoon. One by one, the group members named them: to recenter, to represent the church, to “create a greater connection to this soil,” to “soak it in” — both the day and the conversation. Multiple people referenced an intention to “be present.” All agreed that their intentions had been met.

As others walked out to the parking lot, I stuck around to interview the Headlands. I wanted to know more about what would bring them from California to Louisville to be part of a psychedelic mushroom church. Psychedelic mushroom experiences aren’t always easy — even psychedelics experts like Eric readily admit that — and moving cross-country certainly isn’t, either.

But they were ready. There were still a few months’ worth of logistical preparations to account for, but they already knew what the mushroom — and the Psanctuary community — had done, and would continue to do, for them both.

We continued talking as we walked to the parking lot, backlit by the peak of golden hour. At one point, we stopped — unintentionally — right in front of a single yellow wildflower, which grew alone in a big expanse of grass.

Nancy was elated. It was a serendipitous moment, she said — a beautifully-timed parallel for their upcoming move to Louisville.

“It’s gonna work out the way it’s supposed to work out, and things just keep aligning themselves,” she said. “As we move forward in our journey in this move, things are just working out. And that, to me, is serendipitous. It tells me that we are on the right path, and this is what we need to do.”

# Blockchain Applications in the Nonprofit Sector: Part I – Introduction to Blockchain

  *  December 12, 2022  
  * , Blockchain 

introduction to blockchain for nonprofits 

Blockchain technology has disrupted the way we think about many industries. One major sector that has gone overlooked is the nonprofits industry. Unbeknownst to many, the nonprofit sector is a significant player in the American economy. The United States is home to nearly one and a half million nonprofit organizations, employing more people than the construction, finance, and transportation industries.

Nonprofits contribute nearly two trillion dollars to the American economy annually. Nonprofits come in many shapes and sizes, including hospitals, churches, universities, museums, zoos, and charities. With widespread adoption, blockchain technology will have lasting impacts on all these institutions.

This is the first in a series of blog posts that will discuss various blockchain technologies and how each applies in the nonprofit context. Part I will introduce blockchain technology, Part II will discuss smart contracts, Part III will cover decentralized autonomous organizations, and Part IV will explore cryptocurrencies.

Before discussing the various blockchain technologies and how they can apply to nonprofits, it is important to define what blockchain is and how it works.

## What is Blockchain?

 Blockchain is a digital ledger that records information distributed among a network of computers. Blockchains consist of a series of digital blocks that are securely linked together using cryptography.

These blocks record information such as financial transactions, agreements between parties, and ownership records. Each computer is the network is called a node, and each node stores a copy of the blockchain. The nodes form a peer-to-peer network, where updates are shared and synchronized between all nodes.

Blockchain technology eliminates the need for the third-party intermediaries, such as banks or government agencies, which traditionally have ensured the integrity of transactions and records. Instead, blockchains maintain agreement between all participants using a what is known as a consensus protocol.

A consensus protocol is a set of rules that allows nodes to determine when to add new information to the blockchain. The consensus protocol makes blockchains resistant to tampering.

Fundamentally, blockchain is a process of facilitating transactions in the following manner. First, a transaction is initiated. Next, the transaction is broadcasted to every node in the network. Then, the nodes form a consensus on whether the transaction is valid.

To form the consensus, the nodes each attempt to solve extremely complex mathematical puzzles. This process is called validation. As soon as a node validates a transaction, the node adds the transaction to a block and the block to the blockchain, thus completing the transaction. As the name suggests, blocks are strung together to form a blockchain.

Each individual block contains a piece of information about the previous block. Because of this, in order for a previous block in the chain to be altered, a node would have to not only validate the next block in the chain, but it would have to also validate every other block that comes after that next one.

This is nearly impossible for a single node to accomplish on its own. Accordingly, blockchain is often referred to as a highly secure immutable ledger.

This series will dive into three emerging blockchain technologies: smart contracts, decentralized autonomous organizations, and cryptocurrencies. We will introduce the technologies, how each functions, and describe how they might apply in the nonprofit sector.

**Considering blockchain for a church**

The user is asking how blockchain could help Psanctuary Church, which uses sacred mushrooms as a sacrament. I need to think about possible blockchain applications for the church.

One potential use is membership and identity management. Blockchain can create secure, verifiable digital identities for members, providing a way to securely record memberships, attendance, and sacramental participation. This could ensure privacy while offering transparency and security for the church's records.

I’ll explore how this could streamline management and possibly offer additional benefits.

**Exploring blockchain for Psanctuary**

Blockchain could benefit Psanctuary in several ways. 

Through donations and fundraising, blockchain can offer secure, transparent tracking, using smart contracts to ensure fund allocation and issue tax receipts. Asset tokenization could help raise funds or represent memberships.

It also provides transparency in transactions, which could resonate with Psanctuary’s values. Additionally, using decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) could facilitate democratic governance. 

Blockchain could also offer secure membership verification, immutable sacramental records, and authenticate any content (like sermons). These features could significantly enhance trust and engagement within the community.

Blockchain technology could support Psanctuary church’s mission and operations in several innovative ways, aligning with its emphasis on community, transparency, and non-hierarchical values. Here are some potential applications:

### 1. Transparent Donations and Fundraising  
Using blockchain, the church could set up smart contracts to process donations and fundraising campaigns. Every transaction would be recorded on an immutable ledger, providing donors with clear, real‐time insights into how funds are used. This increased transparency builds trust and accountability within the community.  
citeturn0search9

### 2. Secure Membership and Digital Identity Management  
Psanctuary’s inclusive, community-focused model might benefit from blockchain-based digital identities. Members could receive secure, verifiable credentials that simplify membership registration, protect personal data, and ensure that participation records—such as attendance at sacramental services or minister ordinations—remain accurate and tamper-proof.  
citeturn0search12

### 3. Asset Tokenization and Community Investment  
Taking inspiration from blockchain tokenization models used by other churches, Psanctuary could explore issuing digital tokens. These tokens might represent membership shares or stake in future community projects, allowing members to invest collectively in the church’s growth and infrastructure while fostering a sense of shared ownership.  
citeturn0search5

### 4. Decentralized Governance  
Blockchain platforms can facilitate decentralized decision-making processes. By implementing a voting system based on blockchain, Psanctuary could enable its members to participate directly in governance—aligning with its non-dogmatic, non-hierarchical ethos—and ensuring decisions are made transparently and democratically.

### 5. Immutable Record Keeping for Sacraments and Ordinations  
Maintaining secure, permanent records of sacramental events and ministerial ordinations on a blockchain would safeguard these critical documents. Such an approach not only preserves the history and integrity of these records but also reinforces the church’s commitment to transparency and accountability.

### Conclusion  
By leveraging blockchain technology, Psanctuary church could enhance trust, streamline community engagement, and support its innovative spiritual practices. This integration of modern technology with ancient traditions underscores a forward-thinking approach to religious practice—one that honors both the sacred and the digital age.

Change to reflect holacracy governance

---

## 📝 Message #28 (tool)

*2025-02-16 14:35:11*

**Incorporating Holacracy Governance**

User wants the answer to reflect holacracy governance. The current answer has five points: transparent donations, secure membership, asset tokenization, decentralized governance, and immutable records. To incorporate holacracy, we can change "decentralized governance" to mention how blockchain can support holacracy’s role-based decision-making, transparency, and accountability.

Maybe we adjust the language to say "Decentralized Governance Aligned with Holacracy" to emphasize blockchain's role in empowering teams and distributing leadership. I'll need to make sure this connects with the rest of the points, too.

**Updating for Holacracy Governance**

The system of holacracy distributes power among self-organizing teams, unlike traditional top-down structures. So, I need to reflect this in the updated answer by incorporating holacracy principles, like distributed decision-making, autonomy, and the use of blockchain to support holacratic governance. I'll also check if there are any results specifically mentioning holacracy and blockchain in a church context. I plan to integrate insights from the search and update sections like "decentralized governance" to highlight holacracy specifically.

Blockchain technology can bolster Psanctuary church’s operations by aligning with the principles of holacracy—a decentralized, self-organizing system that distributes authority across autonomous teams rather than relying on a traditional hierarchy. Here’s how blockchain applications can be adapted to reflect holacracy governance:

### 1. Transparent Donations and Fundraising  
Using smart contracts on a blockchain, the church can run donation campaigns and fundraising efforts with complete transparency. Every contribution is immutably recorded, giving donors real‐time insight into fund allocation and reinforcing the accountability valued in both blockchain and holacracy systems.  
citeturn0search9

### 2. Secure Membership and Digital Identity Management  
Blockchain-based digital identities enable secure, verifiable credentials for members. This not only streamlines the registration process and protects personal data but also supports holacracy by ensuring that each member’s role and responsibilities are clearly recorded and accessible across the decentralized organization.  
citeturn0search12

### 3. Asset Tokenization and Community Investment  
Inspired by models in other blockchain-enabled churches, Psanctuary could issue digital tokens representing membership stakes or shares in community projects. This approach fosters collective investment and shared ownership while resonating with holacracy’s emphasis on distributed control and community-driven decision making.  
citeturn0search5

### 4. Holacracy-Driven Decentralized Governance  
Blockchain platforms can be tailored to support holacracy governance by facilitating role-based decision making and real-time, secure voting among autonomous circles. An immutable ledger of decisions can be maintained on the blockchain, ensuring that every role’s input and every circle’s resolutions are transparently recorded. This decentralized system enhances accountability and reflects the church’s non-hierarchical ethos by enabling self-organizing teams to govern their own processes.  

### 5. Immutable Record Keeping for Sacraments and Ordinations  
Recording sacramental events and ministerial ordinations on a blockchain ensures that these critical records are secure, tamper-proof, and permanently accessible. This not only preserves the church’s history but also supports the holacracy model by clearly documenting each decision and role transition without centralized oversight.

### Conclusion  
By integrating blockchain technology with holacracy governance, Psanctuary church can enhance transparency, empower community-driven decision making, and maintain immutable records—all while staying true to its innovative, non-hierarchical ethos. This fusion of ancient spiritual practices with modern decentralized systems illustrates a forward-thinking approach to religious community management.

How would this look with Aleo network's integration of zero-knowledge proofs and programmable privacy?

---

## 📝 Message #32 (tool)

*2025-02-16 14:39:25*

**Explaining Aleo network integration**

The user wants to know how Aleo network’s zero-knowledge proofs and programmable privacy would work within the context of holacracy governance for Psanctuary church. Aleo is a privacy-focused blockchain platform that uses zk-SNARKs to maintain privacy while keeping things auditable and transparent. Integrating Aleo could ensure that sensitive data—like membership and donation details—stay private but still auditable if needed, adding an extra layer of privacy and security to Psanctuary's operations with a decentralized, transparent structure.

**Explaining Aleo network features**

Aleo’s zero-knowledge proofs bring several benefits that align with holacracy governance:

1. **Transparent Donations & Fundraising**: Donors can verify transactions without revealing identities, maintaining privacy but ensuring transparency.  
2. **Secure Membership & Identity**: Members can prove their roles without disclosing personal data, fitting holacracy's decentralized structure.  
3. **Asset Tokenization**: Community tokens can maintain privacy while providing macro-level transparency.  
4. **Decentralized Voting**: Aleo ensures secure, private votes in governance, proven to be correct using zk proofs without exposing details.

---

## 🤖 Assistant Response #33

*2025-02-16 14:39:25*

Integrating Aleo’s zero‐knowledge proofs and programmable privacy with a blockchain framework based on holacracy governance can elevate Psanctuary church’s operations to a new level of security, transparency, and decentralized decision making. Here’s how this integration might look in practice:

### 1. Privacy-Preserving Donation and Fundraising  
- **Secure Transparency:** Donations can be processed via smart contracts on the Aleo network. Zero-knowledge proofs allow the church to publicly verify that funds are allocated according to predetermined rules without revealing donor identities or sensitive financial details.  
- **Enhanced Trust:** Donors can independently verify that every transaction complies with the church’s transparent fundraising policies while their privacy remains intact.

### 2. Confidential Membership and Digital Identity Management  
- **Privacy-First Identities:** Members could receive blockchain-based digital credentials that use zero-knowledge proofs to authenticate their roles within the holacracy. This means members can prove their eligibility and responsibilities without exposing personal data.  
- **Decentralized Role Tracking:** Each member’s role, contributions, and participation in decentralized decision-making circles can be recorded on-chain in an encrypted form, ensuring that sensitive details are visible only to authorized parties.

### 3. Secure Tokenization for Community Investment  
- **Programmable Privacy for Tokens:** When issuing community tokens—whether they represent shares in church projects or stakes in collective assets—Aleo’s programmable privacy ensures individual token balances and transactions remain confidential.  
- **Collective Ownership:** While the overall token economy remains transparent for governance and accountability, the details of personal investments are kept private, aligning with both the spirit of decentralized holacracy and the need for personal privacy.  
citeturn0search5

### 4. Holacracy-Driven Decentralized Governance with Private Voting  
- **Confidential Decision Making:** In a holacracy, decision-making is distributed across autonomous circles. Using zero-knowledge proofs, members can cast votes or submit proposals privately, ensuring that individual opinions are protected while the validity of the vote is cryptographically verifiable.  
- **Immutable and Private Records:** Each decision or role assignment is recorded on the blockchain in a manner that’s immutable and transparent at a macro level, yet the underlying sensitive data remains encrypted—achieving both accountability and privacy.  

### 5. Immutable Record Keeping for Sacraments and Ordinations  
- **Secure Documentation:** Critical events such as sacraments or ministerial ordinations can be recorded using Aleo’s blockchain features. Zero-knowledge proofs allow these records to be validated publicly without exposing personal or sensitive information.  
- **Trust and Verification:** This immutable ledger supports both the historical integrity of the church’s records and the community’s ability to verify these records without compromising individual privacy.

### Conclusion  
By integrating Aleo’s zero-knowledge proofs and programmable privacy, Psanctuary church can realize a blockchain ecosystem that supports holacracy governance in a way that is both transparent and privacy-centric. This approach allows the church to manage donations, memberships, community investments, and governance processes securely—empowering self-organizing teams while protecting sensitive data and individual privacy. This fusion of cutting-edge privacy technology with decentralized governance exemplifies a forward-thinking model that bridges ancient spiritual practices with modern digital innovation.

**Creating the white paper structure**

So, we've been asked to create a white paper for Psanctuary Coin and its Trust. The challenge is to ensure it's both informative and actionable, while still reflecting Psanctuary Coin’s unique mission and spiritual foundation. I’ll need to include the key sections listed and structure them in a readable way. Each section must contain relevant details that highlight the core values of Psanctuary Coin, making sure the document maintains clarity and is aligned with the brand's vision.

**Structuring the white paper**

We have a clear list of sections that need to be included in the white paper for Psanctuary Coin and the Trust. The instructions highlight the need for a readable and actionable document, reflecting the project's mission and spiritual foundation. It should touch on key concepts like tokenomics, governance, and technical architecture. There’s also a note about integrating blockchain and potentially holacracy or Aleo network, though those aren’t explicitly mentioned in the query. I think I’m ready to proceed with structuring the content.

## 1. Introduction & Vision Statement
Psanctuary Coin is envisioned as more than just a digital currency—it is a spiritual tool and community resource designed to nurture a decentralized, transparent, and compassionate ecosystem. Grounded in the belief that true abundance comes from collective giving and shared responsibility, Psanctuary Coin aims to bridge traditional spiritual values with cutting-edge blockchain technology. Our vision is to create an economy that honors sacred practices, fosters global community engagement, and empowers individuals to contribute to collective well-being.

---

## 2. Problem Statement: Why Psanctuary Coin is Needed
Modern financial systems often lack transparency and accessibility, particularly for communities driven by shared values rather than profit. Traditional fundraising models and centralized governance structures can create barriers to true communal participation and limit the flow of resources needed for social and spiritual growth. Psanctuary Coin is designed to address these challenges by:
- Providing a transparent, immutable ledger for donations and expenditures.
- Empowering communities through decentralized decision-making.
- Ensuring that the spiritual and ethical dimensions of giving are recognized and rewarded.

---

## 3. Solution & Core Principles
Psanctuary Coin offers a solution anchored in the following core principles:

- **Transparency:** Every transaction and decision is recorded on an immutable blockchain ledger. Donors, members, and stakeholders can verify the use of funds without compromising personal privacy.
- **Abundance:** Built on a model that promotes continual giving, Psanctuary Coin is designed to circulate wealth within the community, supporting projects and initiatives that uplift spiritual and social well-being.
- **Proof-of-Giving:** Inspired by traditional acts of service, this innovative concept rewards members for their generosity. Validators and community members earn rewards for demonstrating consistent, impactful giving.
- **Holacracy & Decentralization:** Embracing a non-hierarchical, self-organizing model, the coin’s governance empowers every member through decentralized decision-making structures.
- **Spiritual Integrity:** Every technical and operational decision is rooted in a deep commitment to spiritual values, ensuring that technology serves to enhance—not replace—the sacred experience.

---

## 4. Tokenomics
Psanctuary Coin is designed with the following token economic model:

- **Unlimited Supply Model:** Rather than a fixed supply, the coin embraces an unlimited issuance model to continuously support communal growth. The issuance is controlled by community consensus and adjusted based on real-world giving metrics.
- **Staking Mechanism:** Members can stake their coins to support network operations. In return, stakers receive rewards, reinforcing long-term participation.
- **Validator Rewards:** Validators who help secure the network through transaction verification earn rewards. These rewards are proportionate to their contribution and help maintain the network’s integrity.
- **Treasury Structure:** A portion of transaction fees is allocated to a communal treasury. These funds support community projects, maintenance of spiritual programs, and future development initiatives—all managed transparently via on-chain voting.

---

## 5. Governance Model
The governance of Psanctuary Coin is built on a blend of decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) principles and a trust-based, spiritually guided decision-making process:

- **DAO Structure:** Decisions regarding protocol changes, treasury allocations, and strategic initiatives are made collectively through on-chain voting. Every token holder has a voice.
- **Holacratic Trust:** Reflecting our non-hierarchical ethos, governance is distributed across autonomous circles. Each circle manages specific aspects (e.g., community outreach, technical development, spiritual programming) and coordinates with others in a decentralized fashion.
- **Spiritual Decision-Making:** In addition to technical governance, a designated Spiritual Council (elected by the community) offers guidance on ethical, compassionate, and spiritually aligned decisions. Their insights are integrated into the DAO’s proposals to ensure that every decision honors the sacred mission.

---

## 6. Technical Architecture
Psanctuary Coin is built on a robust, substrate-based blockchain platform that supports both financial transactions and spiritual engagement through innovative features:

- **Substrate-Based Framework:** Leveraging modular and customizable blockchain technology for scalability, security, and interoperability.
- **Two-Layer Transactions:** A dual-layer system separates high-speed micro-transactions (for everyday giving and staking rewards) from larger, trust-intensive transactions (such as community investments and treasury allocations).
- **Fee Structure:** Transaction fees are minimal and designed to recycle value back into the community treasury. Advanced mechanisms like Aleo’s zero-knowledge proofs ensure that while transactions are transparent and verifiable, individual privacy is maintained.
- **Programmable Privacy:** Leveraging zero-knowledge proofs and privacy-preserving protocols, the system ensures that sensitive personal data remains confidential while the overall integrity of the ledger is maintained.

---

## 7. Project Management Software & Real-World Applications
To bridge the gap between blockchain technology and real-world community projects, Psanctuary Coin integrates with specialized project management tools:

- **Integrated PM Software:** A tailored platform will track projects, document milestones, and measure the impact of initiatives funded by the treasury. This ensures clear accountability and strategic alignment with the church’s spiritual mission.
- **Real-World Use Cases:** 
  - **Community Outreach:** Tracking charitable projects and community service initiatives.
  - **Spiritual Programs:** Managing events, workshops, and retreats.
  - **Infrastructure Projects:** Funding and overseeing the maintenance and expansion of church facilities or community centers.

---

## 8. Roadmap & Development Phases
The roadmap for Psanctuary Coin is divided into clear, actionable phases:

- **Phase 1: Research & Design (Q3 2025)**
  - Finalize technical architecture and tokenomics.
  - Engage community and spiritual leaders to refine the governance model.
- **Phase 2: Development & Testing (Q4 2025 – Q1 2026)**
  - Build the blockchain network on a substrate-based framework.
  - Integrate zero-knowledge proof modules for programmable privacy.
  - Pilot the staking, validator rewards, and treasury systems.
- **Phase 3: Community Launch & DAO Formation (Q2 2026)**
  - Launch Psanctuary Coin and establish the DAO.
  - Begin the initial round of on-chain governance proposals.
- **Phase 4: Expansion & Real-World Integration (Q3 2026 and beyond)**
  - Integrate with project management software.
  - Roll out use cases with partner organizations.
  - Continuously update the protocol based on community feedback and evolving spiritual needs.

---

## 9. Use Cases
Psanctuary Coin’s versatility allows it to be adopted across various organizations and scenarios:

- **Faith-Based Communities:** Churches and spiritual centers can use the coin for transparent donation management, community voting, and funding spiritual projects.
- **Nonprofit Organizations:** Nonprofits can benefit from an immutable ledger of giving, ensuring accountability and fostering trust among donors.
- **Social Enterprises:** Businesses driven by social impact can utilize the coin for employee incentives, community engagement, and transparent reinvestment of profits.
- **Collaborative Networks:** Cross-organizational alliances can adopt Psanctuary Coin for joint projects, shared governance, and pooled resources—all under a trust-based, decentralized model.

---

## 10. Fundraising & Treasury Allocation
Psanctuary Coin adopts a gradual, organic growth model without an initial coin offering (ICO):

- **No ICO Model:** Instead of a public ICO, the coin will be distributed gradually through community participation, staking rewards, and fundraising events.
- **Gradual Growth:** Funds are raised through a series of community initiatives, ensuring that growth is steady and sustainable.
- **Treasury Allocation:** The treasury is managed by the DAO and Spiritual Council. Allocation of funds will be transparently decided through on-chain voting, with strict guidelines to support community projects, technical development, and ongoing spiritual programs.

---

## 11. Future Plans & Scalability
Looking forward, Psanctuary Coin is designed with scalability and long-term evolution in mind:

- **Protocol Upgrades:** Regular updates based on community proposals will ensure the platform remains state-of-the-art and aligned with spiritual needs.
- **Broader Ecosystem Integration:** Plans to integrate with other decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 applications will further empower community projects and cross-organizational collaborations.
- **Global Outreach:** As the coin and its governance model mature, Psanctuary Coin will serve as a model for other faith-based communities worldwide, fostering an interconnected network of spiritually aligned organizations.
- **Continuous Innovation:** Ongoing research into emerging blockchain technologies (such as advanced privacy protocols and scalable consensus mechanisms) will keep the project at the forefront of digital and spiritual innovation.

---

## Conclusion
Psanctuary Coin represents a fusion of technology and spirituality, offering a decentralized, transparent, and inclusive economic model for communities driven by compassion and collective giving. By harnessing substrate-based blockchain technology, zero-knowledge proofs, and holacratic governance, Psanctuary Coin and the Psanctuary Coin Trust pave the way for a future where every transaction, every vote, and every act of giving is both a sacred and verifiable contribution to a more abundant, interconnected world.

Write up a quick text to our founding minsters/dear friends of mine excited to meet up and discuss this in more detail and to gather more information from the team to incorporate everything appropriately as I obviously do not know the extent of what they manage not being with the finance team full-time but they do share their finances openly for the public already :)

**Hey [Name/s]!**  

I’m really excited to connect and explore this Psanctuary Coin vision with you in more detail. I’d love to meet up soon and hear more from the team—especially to better understand the full scope of what’s already being stewarded and shared financially.  

While I’m not on the finance team full-time, I want to make sure anything I bring forward truly aligns with what’s already in place and honors all the good work happening behind the scenes. I know you’re already modeling transparency beautifully, and I’d love to integrate that into a spiritually grounded, tech-supported approach that could bless the community even more.

Looking forward to syncing up soon—grateful as always for the love and leadership you carry. 🙏

With love and excitement,

I’m holding them lightly and would love to connect and listen more deeply to what’s already in place and what’s being carried by the team and continue building and testing before I propose anything.

So… I may have mentioned that I started a 1-on-1 blockchain/Web3 mentorship (thanks to a little nudge from our own Johann 🙏). I’ve been sitting with some financial ideas that have been stirring in me—ones that *might* support what we’re building together and possibly invite a more sacred, relational way of holding money in community.  

I’m holding these ideas lightly and would love to connect and listen more deeply to what’s already in place and what the team is carrying. My hope is to keep building and testing quietly before offering anything concrete. I know there’s a lot I don’t see from the outside, and I want to move with care, openness, and reverence.  

That said, I’m feeling the nudge to explore this together—and I’m just really grateful to walk this path with you in faith and curiosity, trusting where Spirit may lead us ✨

---

So… I may have mentioned that I began a 1-on-1 mentorship in blockchain/Web3 development (following a gentle nudge from our beloved Johann 🙏). It’s been part of a larger stirring I’ve felt—less like an idea from my mind, and more like something being revealed gradually in the quiet.  

There’s been a sense that this could support what we’re building together—perhaps even invite a more sacred and Spirit-led way of holding money in community. I’m holding it all very lightly, still in listening and testing mode, and would love to sit with you and hear more about what’s already being carried by the team.  

I know I can’t see the full picture from the outside, and I deeply want to approach this with humility, openness, and care. Just grateful to be walking this path with you—and feeling a nudge to explore where Spirit might be leading us next, together. ✨🙏

Beautiful. Here’s a version that brings it all together—your unfolding journey, the spirit of revelation, humility in discernment, and your shared testimony of purpose at Psanctuary. It’s prayerful, grounded, and relational, while still leaving space for mystery and movement:

---

So… I may have shared that I began a 1-on-1 mentorship in blockchain and Web3 (after a gentle nudge from Johann 🙏). But more than a technical path, it’s felt like part of a quiet unfolding—less an idea I’m chasing, and more something being revealed.  

As I’ve leaned into it, I’ve sensed the possibility of something that might support what we’re building together—maybe even open space for a more sacred and Spirit-led way of holding money and shared resources in community. I’m not arriving with answers, just a deep desire to listen well and build with integrity.  

I’d love to connect soon—mostly to hear what’s already being carried by the team and to better understand the fullness of the financial landscape before testing anything further. I know I don’t see everything from where I stand, and I want to move with humility, reverence, and care.  

At the heart of it, I just keep coming back to our shared testimony: that we are co-creating something rooted in love, trust, and liberation—where nothing is withheld, and everything is made sacred in the giving. I’m simply grateful to be walking this path with you, open to wherever Spirit may lead us next. ✨🙏

Here’s a refined mock‑up for **“Sacred DAO”**—a community governance model deeply rooted in the principles of *Tao Te Ching*, especially **wu‑wei**, **humility**, and **flow**.

---

## 🌿 Sacred DAO — A Tao-Aligned Governance Framework

### ✨ Core Taoist Principles
1. **Wu‑wei (Non‑Action)**  
   - *“Do nothing and everything is done.”* citeturn0search0turn0search3  
   - We allow decisions to emerge naturally from the collective; nothing is forced.  
2. **Humility & Frugality**  
   - Inspired by the *Three Treasures*: compassion, simplicity, humility citeturn0search12  
   - The DAO remains transparent, modest, and free from power-seeking.  
3. **Natural Flow & Interconnectedness**  
   - Like water that nourishes the lowest places citeturn0search3  
   - Governance flows from the wisdom of connections and balance.

---

### 🧭 How Sacred DAO Works

#### 1. **Flow-Based Governance (Wu‑wei in Action)**  
- **Proposal system:** Open to all—no centralized filtering.  
- **Informal incubation:** Short dialogues among contributors, not lengthy top-down paperwork.  
- **Consensus emerges:** Clear, heartfelt support surfaces—not through force, but rhythm.  
- **Evolving delegation:** Roles shift fluidly based on contribution and spirit.

#### 2. **Cultivating the Three Treasures**
- **Compassion:** Decisions are made with empathy and care.  
- **Simplicity:** Processes stay light, clear, and minimal.  
- **Humility:** Leaders are servants; everyone is equal before the Spirit.

#### 3. **Spiritual Flow & Balance**  
- **Dynamic roles:** Circles and responsibilities adapt like yin-yang balance.  
- **Seasonal rhythm:** Meetings follow natural ebb-and-flow—no forced scheduling.  
- **Reflection periods:** After major decisions, time is given to see how the community is doing.

---

### 🌱 Example Workflow

| Step | Action | Tao Principle |
|------|--------|---------------|
| 1    | Member shares idea (e.g., community garden) | **Wu‑wei**: Speak, without agenda |
| 2    | Small circle gathers for open-discussion | **Flow**: Natural emergence of clarity |
| 3    | If supported, formal proposal submitted | **Simplicity**: Short, clear, relational |
| 4    | Quiet voting over a period, with no pressure | **Non-interference**: Let consensus arise |
| 5    | If approved, resources allocated & work begins | **Compassion**: Support sustained effort |
| 6    | Reflection, feedback, celebration | **Humility**: Recognize imperfection and growth |

---

### 🌬️ Language & Culture Alignment
- Proposals are called **“Whispers”**—gentle suggestions, not demands.  
- Decisions modeled as **“Paths”**—not rigid mandates.  
- Community invites gentle wisdom—**“Listening Circles”**—before voting.

---

### 🪷 Why “Sacred DAO” & Tao Together?
- *Tao is the way of the cosmos—the natural unfolding of life.* citeturn0search14turn0search2  
- The **Sacred DAO** embodies that way—acting in harmony, with humility, effortless flow, balance, and heartfelt interconnectedness.

---

### 🧩 In Summary
The **Sacred DAO** is not just a system—it’s a **way of being together**. Rooted in Taoist wisdom, it honors the divine in everyone, encourages emergent leadership, fosters trust through gentleness, and invites every decision to arise from collective spirit—not tension. It’s governance by the Way.

## 🤖 Assistant Response #134

*2025-07-13 12:08:48*

Here are a few playful puns on “Tao Te Ching” with a mushroom twist—each riffing on a different fungus:

- **Shii‑take‑Ching** (shiitake + Ching)  
- **Morel‑te Ching** (morel + te Ching)  
- **Chanter‑elle‑Ching** (chanterelle + Ching)  
- **Por‑Chingini** (porcini + Ching)  
- **Enoki‑o‑Ching** (enoki + Ching)  

My personal favorite for a tongue‑in‑cheek “mushroom scripture” vibe is **“Morel‑te Ching”**—it even hints at “moral teaching” beyond the pun. 🍄✨

how about adding to our notion the name: Psilobrate -> SporeDAO: the DAO de mycelium - a dao of sacred fun-guys and gals by Psanctuary's mycouncil and adding this poem content to our sentiment: "A Psilocybin Poem
A veil lifts, a new perception starts,
Colors bleed, form dissolves, like fleeting artistic creations
The mind expands, a boundless realm,
Where time and space become a playful dream.
Laughter erupts, childlike and free,
A kaleidoscope of joy, dancing vividly.
Old wounds may stir, like shadows in the light,
But understanding dawns, bringing clarity and calm to the inner site.
The self unravels, ego fades away,
Connecting deeper, as if everything is happening today.
A sense of belonging, a profound embrace,
In the vastness of the universe, finding a peaceful and loving space."

I expanded the **Chain (Substrate‑based)** line to explain what Substrate is, why it’s chosen, and how it integrates with our privacy and governance goals. Let me know if you’d like further details or links!

I removed the brainstorm and poem sections, and rewrote the **Vision & Purpose** to anchor our DAO in the mycelial substrate metaphor—highlighting how member contributions act as spores growing into communal abundance. Let me know if you want mushroom humor or analogies sprinkled into other sections!
