User wants the staking rewards and tokenomics for the anonymous voting platform to align with Aleo’s existing token model, supply, and staking mechanics.

I’ve been working with augment Claude sonnet and gpt5 to create the front end on the website I’ll share once hosted but here is where we are at with the tokenomics. Review and help flesh this out with sustainability for our project:

Could you clarify what you'd like me to focus on while researching Hampton P2E farming game on Telegram?

For example:
1. Are you primarily interested in their tokenomics (how rewards are distributed)?
2. Would you like details on how players interact with the game (UX/flow)?
3. Are you looking for how they integrate Telegram features like bots, stickers, or in-app purchases?
4. Should I also explore how they use "Telegram Stars" and whether it's viable for your ecosystem?

Let me know which of these — or anything else — you'd like me to prioritize!

Great, I’ll prepare a comprehensive overview of how HOT Wallet’s mining system works. This will include its technical mechanics, reward model, user experience, tokenomics, gamification elements, and potential integration with platforms like Telegram and TON. I’ll also evaluate how it could inspire features or design decisions for your own project.

I’ll let you know as soon as it’s ready to review.

Could you clarify what aspects of Solidus’ AITech Pad P2E Telegram app you’d like to understand better? For example:

1. Tokenomics or reward structure?
2. How the Telegram mini-app works technically?
3. Role of Solidus’ Agent Forge and how it might integrate with your Oracle of Fruit concept?
4. Any other specific features or inspiration you’re looking for?

This will help me do a focused deep dive for your project.

Great. I’ll research the tokenomics and reward structure of Solidus’ AITech Pad P2E Telegram app, along with how the Telegram mini-app functions technically. I’ll also explore how Solidus’ Agent Forge could be used to create or support intelligent agents like your Oracle of Fruit. I’ll get back to you with a comprehensive breakdown shortly.

The tokenomics and reward structure — including how users earn, how rewards are distributed, if there are multipliers, penalties, tiers, etc.\n2. The technical structure of the Telegram mini-app — how it's built, what tech stack is used, how it interacts with users, and any available APIs or tools for replication or integration.\n\nThen, analyze how Solidus’ Agent Forge could be leveraged to create or support intelligent agents within a similar ecosystem. Specifically, provide ideas on how this platform could contribute to the user’s Oracle of Fruit or broader agent crew within a spiritually resonant, gamified P2E system. Include concrete use cases, integration suggestions, and benefits.\n\nPlease format as a report with clear sections, bullet points, and any available visual aids or diagrams for clarity. Prioritize official sources, developer documentation, and firsthand user experiences."
