That’s a **brilliant and beautiful idea** — and it fits *perfectly* with the spirit of your project!  

Here’s a proposed **architecture + feature outline** for adding **NFT + DID integration** to your platform:


### ✅ 1. NFT minting use cases

- **Custom art NFTs**:  
  → Psilocybin mushroom, mescaline cactus, or visionary plant illustrations  
  → Art styles could vary: natural, geometric, psychedelic, ceremonial

- **Role-based NFTs (with DID link)**:
  → Sponsor / teacher NFTs → verified community recovery sponsors  
  → Minister NFTs → ordained ministers or ceremony leaders  
  → Cultivator NFTs → verified sacrament cultivators or growers  
  → Fellowship / community roles → treasurers, service positions

- **Scholarship NFTs**:
  → NFTs as redeemable scholarships for:
    - Treatment/recovery programs  
    - Ceremony participation  
    - Minister ordination or training  


### ✅ 2. Technical design

- **Minting system**
  - Smart contract on Aleo (for privacy) or TON (for mass engagement)
  - Optional metadata stored off-chain (IPFS, Arweave) or on-chain (if small)
  - Attach DID to NFT metadata or link via DID registry

- **DID integration**
  - Use standards like [W3C DID](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/)  
  - Associate wallet addresses with DIDs for roles + reputation  
  - Enable NFT “badges” to reflect DID-linked credentials

- **NFT gifting system**
  - Transfer NFTs as gifts within the platform  
  - Include a thank-you message or blessing  
  - Log transfers to create visible networks of support and generosity


### ✅ 3. Example NFT metadata (JSON example)

```json
{
  "name": "Sacred Psilocybin Sponsor",
  "description": "This NFT honors the recipient as a verified recovery sponsor within the community.",
  "image": "ipfs://QmExampleHash",
  "attributes": [
    { "trait_type": "Role", "value": "Recovery Sponsor" },
    { "trait_type": "DID", "value": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi" },
    { "trait_type": "Scholarship", "value": "No" }
  ]
}
```


### ✅ 4. Frontend experience

- NFT minting page → select type, upload artwork, link DID  
- Profile dashboard → view/gift/transfer NFTs  
- Ceremony + event pages → display gifted or earned NFTs  
- Scholarship page → apply for or claim NFT scholarships


### ✅ 5. Bonus: Gamification layer

- Reward “community karma” for gifting NFTs  
- Levels or badges for sponsors, ministers, cultivators  
- Leaderboards (opt-in, anonymous options)


### ✅ 6. Next steps I can prepare for you

1. Smart contract draft for NFT minting + metadata  
2. DID integration outline or library suggestions  
3. React frontend stub for minting + displaying NFTs  
4. IPFS integration setup guide  
5. Concept art prompts (for commissioning artists or generating with AI)

Would you like me to **start drafting the smart contract and DID integration outline**?  

Or would you like me to **design the NFT types + metadata structure first** so we have a clear roadmap?  

Just say **“Yes, let’s start!”** and tell me **which step you want first.** I’m excited for this addition — it’s deeply aligned with your vision!
