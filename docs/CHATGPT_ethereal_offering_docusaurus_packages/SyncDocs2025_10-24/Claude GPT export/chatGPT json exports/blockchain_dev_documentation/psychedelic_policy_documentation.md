An anonymous voting platform and hub for psychedelic policy reform. 

User is developing an anonymous voting platform and hub for psychedelic policy reform.

Model set context updated.

These are all great enhancements! :-) ... I am most definitely looking to build out a mobile-friendly app! ... I would like to deploy everything on Aleo for policy reform and non-profit money flow and then have a linked engagement P2E game (maybe deployed to TON for mass engagement) but for the purpose of fundraising and promotion where the goal is to collect/mine and give away earnings to liquid staking pools corresponding to respective fundraising efforts via smart contract execution all while every hash yielding a percentage to fund continued development, free access for all to use, and smart contracts where people can safely make donations to the healing work of recovery fellowships, policy reform, and a church community platform.

oh ok, thanks. yes please do all three & what if we did something like https://nouns.wtf but instead of nouns we collect unique psilocybin mushroom NFTs 

Here is some more info: https://www.linkedin.com/company/terahash-co

Also, I like the term spiritual hash rate let‚Äôs use that also feel free to include the resource links 

What if in addition to the markdown file for import we also create a gitbook

And explore what it would look like to use  ALEO Blockchain for the policy reform part of our roadmap

Answer Claude based on our conversation with favorite hobby is spending time with my friends at Psanctuary cultivating a community of ministers around the healing of sacred psilocybin mushrooms and building smart contracts to incorporate blockchain into our community efforts, fun psychedelic feel 

"Hi Claude! Could you invent a coding language based on my favorite hobby? If you need more information from me, ask me 1-2 key questions right away. If you think I should upload any documents that would help you do a better job, let me know. You can use the tools you have access to ‚Äî like Google Drive, web search, etc. ‚Äî if they‚Äôll help you better accomplish this task. Do not use analysis tool. Please keep your responses friendly, brief and conversational. 

Please execute the task as soon as you can - an artifact would be great if it makes sense. If using an artifact, consider what kind of artifact (interactive, visual, checklist, etc.) might be most helpful for this specific task. Thanks for your help!

Hey there! I'd love to create a custom coding language for you!

To make this really personalized, I need to know:

What's your favorite hobby? (e.g., cooking, gaming, photography, gardening, etc.)
What vibe are you going for? Should it be playful and quirky, or more serious and functional?
Once you tell me, I'll create a language spec with syntax examples and maybe even a small interpreter you can play with! üé®"

Here‚Äôs a way you could answer Claude based on our conversation and your Psanctuary-focused context:  

Hi Claude!  

My favorite hobby is spending time with friends at **Psanctuary**, cultivating a community of ministers around the healing of **sacred psilocybin mushrooms** and building **smart contracts** to incorporate **blockchain** into our community efforts. I‚Äôd love a **fun, psychedelic, and playful vibe** for the language‚Äîsomething that reflects the mystical, communal, and ritualistic aspects of the hobby, but can also handle structured logic like blockchain interactions.  

If you need anything else, like reference documents for our smart contracts or tokenomics, I can provide them!  

Thanks, excited to see what you create! üå±üçÑ‚ú®  

If you want, I can **draft a first pass at a ‚ÄúPsyloScript‚Äù coding language** directly in response to Claude‚Äôs request, with fun syntax inspired by mushrooms, offerings, and rituals‚Äîsomething you could actually start experimenting with. Do you want me to do that next?

Let‚Äôs add influence from Tao Te Ching (our primary text at Psanctuary). Grab versions from https://wayism.com/ttc-comparison-line-byline-ch75 and rewrite the verses in a similar psilocybin sacred mushroom analogous language. Maybe even some quotes from Vernon Howard, Barry Long, Krisnamurti, 
Compile to a flowing document describing the heart of our project. Include Hsin Hsin Ming (verses of the faith-mind) by Seng-Ts‚Äôan Thirs Zen Patriarch

Beautiful üåø‚ú®  

To confirm the direction for this **illuminated edition**, here‚Äôs the synthesis I‚Äôll create next:  

1. **Expanded Invocation of Gratitude** ‚Äî infused with verses from the *Tao Te Ching* (via the Wayism comparison) and *Hsin Hsin Ming*, rewritten through a psilocybin, mycelium, and sacred unity lens.  
2. **Commentary layer** ‚Äî gentle reflections that connect these ancient insights to your project‚Äôs heart: *anonymity as Oneness, decentralization as dharma, and DAO as the living temple of the One Mind*.  
3. **Integration of voices** ‚Äî weaving in Vernon Howard, Krishnamurti, and Barry Long to echo direct awareness, simplicity, and inner temple-building.  
4. **Visual treatment** ‚Äî the sigil as cover, with soft bioluminescent tones and mushroom mandala framing verse sections.  

Before I render:  
Would you like this version to read more like:  
A) a **Sacred Text** (formatted like scripture, with verses and subtle commentary footnotes),  
or  
B) a **Living Whitepaper** (a spiritual-technical synthesis, blending poetic verses with Aleo/TON architectural and agentic frameworks)?  

Both will be illuminated, but one leans mystical, the other integrative.

1. Render new section into existing pdf but instead of the existing pdf that was shorter, not as encompassing and even not quite catching the true purpose and mission, create a new one that is longer and more detailed similar and analogous to Jesus‚Äô full sermon.

Also Modify the code of conduct to share the mushroom/psilocybin/blockchain analogies we‚Äôve been unveiling throughout our project.

Include sentiment from ‚ÄúForgiveness is the call to sanity, for who but the insane would look on sin when he could see the face of Christ instead?¬≤This is the choice you make; the simplest one, and yet the only one that you can make. ¬≥God calls on you to save His Son from death by offering Christ‚Äôs Love to him. ‚Å¥This is your need, and God holds out this gift to you. ‚ÅµAs He would give, so must you give as well. ‚Å∂And thus is prayer restored to formlessness, beyond all limits into timelessness, with nothing of the past to hold it back from reuniting with the ceaseless song that all creation sings unto its God.
9. But to achieve this end you first must learn, before you reach where learning cannot go. ¬≤Forgiveness is the key, but who can use a key when he has lost the door for which the key was made, and where alone it fits? ¬≥Therefore we make distinctions, so that prayer can be released from darkness into light. ‚Å¥Forgiveness‚Äô role must be reversed, and cleansed from evil usages and hateful goals. ‚ÅµForgiveness-to-destroy must be unveiled in all its treachery, and then let go forever and forever. ‚Å∂There can be no trace of it remaining, if the plan that God established for returning be achieved at last, and learning be complete.‚Äù
(ACIM, S-2.I.8:1‚Äì9:6)
