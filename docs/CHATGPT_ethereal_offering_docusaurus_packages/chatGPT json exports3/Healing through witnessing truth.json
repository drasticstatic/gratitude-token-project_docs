We stand instead as living witnesses to the Truth in those who believe themselves apart from it. We behold every soul as already whole, already healed, already Home in the Mind of God.\n\nOur work is not to fix the body nor to chase away pain, but to join in the healing of the mind \u2014 together, as one awakening Self. The patterns of addiction, the stories of trauma, the shadows of guilt and fear \u2014 these we do not judge as real, but recognize as calls for love. And in that recognition, the Spirit gently reinterprets every symptom into a sacred opportunity for forgiveness, freedom, and remembrance.\n\nWhile the world looks to medicines, we do not deny the helpful symbols the mind can accept: the sacraments of the earth, rest, nutrition, ceremony, and loving counsel. These are gifts through which the Spirit may move, if invited. They are not ends in themselves, but means \u2014 symbols through which we learn the holy art of surrender and the deeper meaning of true healing.\n\nHealing cannot be imposed. It is received in willingness \u2014 a quiet shift in perception:  \nfrom guilt to innocence,  \nfrom separation to oneness,  \nfrom fear to love.  \n\nHere we remember that we share one Being, one Mind, one Will in God. Each teacher is a student, and each student a teacher \u2014 mirrors of the same Light, revealing to one another what has never been lost.  \n\nOur recovery is not a return from sickness, but a return to truth. It is the moment we accept what has always been so: that we are still as Love created us.  \nTogether, we choose to recover \u2014 by giving what we would receive, and receiving what we give.  \n\nThis is the ethos of Psanctuary:  \na place not of treatment, but of remembrance;  \nnot of fixing, but of joining;  \nnot of striving, but of resting in the grace already given.  \n\nAre you ready to remember your wholeness with us?  \n\n---\n\nWould you like me to shape this into a formal **ethos statement** (with title formatting, tagline, and short paragraph summary for your website or whitepaper), or keep it as a **liturgical-style reflection** for community reading and ceremony?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [200002]}, "is_complete": true, "citations": [], "content_references": [], "request_id": "98eb443a3d1ad6a3-IAD", "message_type": "next", "model_slug": "gpt-5", "default_model_slug": "auto", "parent_id": "31d2a569-18f0-4eb0-9980-311b31b193bf", "turn_exchange_id": "cdb7de6c-9f71-40ae-a504-16e2c08beb61", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "31d2a569-18f0-4eb0-9980-311b31b193bf", "children": []}}, "moderation_results": [], "current_node": "bb49e42f-e4b2-412a-a969-67b5774f5cbb", "plugin_ids": null, "conversation_id": "68eeed3c-6068-8324-a5d8-7f49935ceafc", "conversation_template_id": "g-p-68ea65e728ac8191a1a2da026af6b06d", "gizmo_id": "g-p-68ea65e728ac8191a1a2da026af6b06d", "gizmo_type": "snorlax", "is_archived": false, "is_starred": null, "safe_urls": [], "blocked_urls": [], "default_model_slug": "auto", "conversation_origin": null, "voice": null, "async_status": null, "disabled_tool_ids": [], "is_do_not_remember": false, "memory_scope": "global_enabled", "context_scopes": null, "sugar_item_id": null, "sugar_item_visible": false, "is_study_mode": false, "owner": null, "id": "68eeed3c-6068-8324-a5d8-7f49935ceafc"}
