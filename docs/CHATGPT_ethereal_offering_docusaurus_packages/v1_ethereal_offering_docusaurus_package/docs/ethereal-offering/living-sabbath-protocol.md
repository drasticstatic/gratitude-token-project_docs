# DAO Living Sabbath Protocol

This protocol encodes rhythms of rest, reflection, and gratitude into DAO governance. It is both a spiritual practice and a resilience mechanism — ensuring the DAO does not burn its stewards or treat contributors as replaceable units of labor.

## Objectives

- Embed cyclical rest (Sabbath cycles) into treasury disbursements and governance activity.
- Provide protections and grace periods to contributors during seasons of hardship.
- Use on-chain signals to trigger communal reflection and gratitude rituals.

## Key Mechanisms

1. **Sabbath Window:** A recurring governance window (e.g., one week each quarter) where non-emergency proposals are paused and community rituals (gratitude logs, memorials, communal prayers) are highlighted.

2. **Sabbath Treasury Reserve:** A fraction of the treasury (configurable) is reserved for sabbath use — community grants, care funds, and emergency relief.

3. **Rest Credits:** Contributors accrue "Rest Credits" based on service, which can be exchanged for on-chain care benefits (time-limited grants, legal aid, counseling vouchers).

4. **Grace Voting Mode:** When contributors report severe hardship, they may trigger a "Grace Voting Mode" that temporarily increases community support weighting for aid proposals.

## Governance Integration

- Amend DAO bylaws to include Sabbath parameters (window length, reserve percentage, rest credit issuance rules).
- Implement smart contract guardrails to enforce the Sabbath reserve and require a higher quorum for bypassing sabbath protections.

## Implementation Notes

- Start with a simple on-chain flag and off-chain rituals; formalize with smart contracts after community testing.
- Provide educational materials for church/fellowship partners to understand spiritual intent and avoid legal pitfalls.
