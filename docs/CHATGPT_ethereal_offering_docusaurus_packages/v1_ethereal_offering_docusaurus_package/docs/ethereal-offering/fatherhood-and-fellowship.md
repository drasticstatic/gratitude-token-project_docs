# Fatherhood & Fellowship — A Preface

_A reflection by Christopher (drasticstatic)_

It is autumn in Pennsylvania. The rain brings abundance; I carry firewood into the house and remember the seasons — both of life and of crypto. We plant, we harvest, and we lay by in the Father's storehouse so that when winter comes, the warmth of community remains.

This project is born from the sacred pause — a space where presence with my children (human, animal, plant, and fungi) becomes the measure of what truly matters. The Ethereal Offering is an invitation: to harmonize code and covenant, technology and tenderness.

## Core Commitments

- **Presence first.** The work must free its steward to tend life and love.  
- **Spiritual coin.** Gratitude Tokens are instruments of service, not speculation.  
- **Redemption-centered governance.** Decisions flow from mercy, truth, and restoration.  
- **Stewardship as worship.** Build so others can continue; encode sabbath into practice.

## How this Preface should be used

Include this preface as the human-facing introduction on the Docusaurus site. Use plain language for church audiences and a technical sidebar for developer readers. Keep it in the docs' top-level navigation so visitors feel the heart of the project immediately.
