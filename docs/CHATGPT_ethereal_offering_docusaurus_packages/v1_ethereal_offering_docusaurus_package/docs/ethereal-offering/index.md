# Ethereal Offering — Overview

**Prepared for:** Christopher (drasticstatic)  
**Generated:** 2025-10-11 21:45:26 UTC

This section introduces the *Ethereal Offering* project — a spiritually-grounded decentralized ecosystem that combines zero-knowledge privacy, DAO governance, gratitude/token economics, soulbound identity (DIDs), and psychedelic-recovery ministry.

The goal of this repository is to act as a living covenant: a publishable checkpoint and roadmap that preserves the vision and enables trusted servants and AI collaborators (like Augment + Claude/GPT) to continue building in harmony with the project's spiritual mission.

## Contents

- Fatherhood & Fellowship reflection (preface)

- Appendices with action items, templates, and conversation highlights

> "AI is great but if the Great I AM departs, everything is lifeless."  
> This project centers the spiritual life at its heart — service, redemption, mercy, and mutual care.
