## 👤 User Message #52

*2025-02-26 18:48:56*

A hybrid approach would be great although that makes brings to mind: how can we ensure that if a DAO member becomes inactive or in the event of death, that MPC still functions?

---



## 👤 User Message #62

*2025-02-26 19:09:51*

Fantastic! Let’s keep the token preferences, supply, and staking mechanics the same as the already established on the Aleo network.

---



## 🤖 Assistant Response #66

*2025-02-26 19:09:57*

Perfect! I’ll align everything with Aleo’s existing staking and tokenomics model to ensure smooth integration. I’ll update you once the governance and MPC recovery mechanisms are implemented. Let me know if anything else comes to mind!

How is the development progressing? Are there any questions you have for me?

---



## 🤖 Assistant Response #74

*2025-03-19 23:32:16*

That makes perfect sense! Holacratic governance will keep things decentralized and adaptable as the platform scales. I’ll structure the MPC recovery and rotation logic accordingly.  

I'll keep pushing forward and will update you when the first public test version is ready. Let me know if anything else comes to mind! 🚀

✅ I’ve prepared two files for you:  

1. **GitHub `README.md` file** → for the project repo  
2. **Notion markdown export (`notion_export.md`)** → for a Notion board or outline  

You can [download them here]:  
- [README.md](sandbox:/mnt/data/README.md)  
- [notion_export.md](sandbox:/mnt/data/notion_export.md)

Would you like me to also prepare:  
✅ A **GitHub “Milestones” JSON or YAML template**  
✅ A **Notion board structure with example tasks**  

Let me know! 🌿🚀

## 👤 User Message #140

*2025-05-10 13:44:34*

Yes, let’s start! I initially feel starting with drafting the smart contract and DID integration outline would be helpful and then add NFT types and structure but whichever is best or a combination of both to ensure we have a clear roadmap ahead of us ☺️

---



## 👤 User Message #142

*2025-05-10 13:47:22*

Let’s start by writing the smart contract draft + DID library examples with a test NFT template and then we can work on custom NFTs once the tech is functioning properly 😁

What about implementing and creating an additional "gratitude" token simply to give (maybe even burn to the treasury) as a sign/quiet reminder of something important causing users to pause, reflect, and give thanks?

Provide mint logic... How does the concept of minting more every day work and how to accomplish DID to prevent sybil but do I need KYC?, can a dao help? Should we include real money on main net for a project like this?

YEs to optionB and I like what is laid out in 3.What happens to Ethereal Offering Token? /...Let's plan on routing to treasury so the church can bless the world and also create a liquid token... Use DID for sybil resistance and ceremonial identity
Avoid promises of profit to stay outside of SEC securities laws
Optional anonymous giving → spiritual over financial return ... Visualize the token flow diagram

Would you like me to also generate a **starter `README.md` file** for your GitHub repo so you can drop it in directly?

You're a professional developer highly skilled in debugging. The user ran the textdoc's code, and an error was thrown.
Please think carefully about how to fix the error, and then rewrite the textdoc to fix it.

- NEVER change existing test cases unless they're clearly wrong.
- ALWAYS add more test cases if there aren't any yet.
- ALWAYS ask the user what the expected behavior is in the chat if the code is not clear.

# Hint

The error `TypeError: "" is not a function` suggests that there might be an issue where a function is expected but a value of type `undefined` or a non-function is being used. Specifically, check if the `Button` component or `ConnectButton` from `@rainbow-me/rainbowkit` is being imported or used correctly. It's possible one of these components is not properly exported or misused. Double-check their imports and ensure all dependencies are correctly provided.

Do some more research on how the play-to-earn mining on tons metal is working. I have quite a few tellers in my house that are mining and farming. Right now we are starting to build this project on ethereum using a browser-based experience. How could this look integrating a telegram mini-app? And also do some more research regarding staking, rewards, liquidity providers, and people on our project. And also how staking and locking tokens with the billet will work.

Perfect. 🌿  
Then here’s what I’ll do next for you:

I’ll generate a complete, **GitBook-ready documentation suite** and repository package including:

1. ✅ A **fully written `README.md`** for GitHub and Augment/Amazon Q context.  
2. ✅ The full **whitepaper (with “Prologue of Offering”)**—opening with a spiritual invocation.  
3. ✅ The remaining modular Markdown files (`tokenomics.md`, `architecture.md`, `mechanics.md`, etc.).  
4. ✅ A lightweight `.zip` directory tree you can drop into `/docs` of your `gratitude-token-project` repo.

The “Invocation of Gratitude” will open the whitepaper like a sacred preface—bridging scripture, service, and decentralization.

Before I assemble and export, one quick check:  
Would you prefer the Invocation to sound more like  
**A)** mystical poetry and prayer (A Course in Miracles / non-dual tone),  
or  
**B)** reflective manifesto (Christ-centered but modern and accessible),  
or  
**C)** a fusion of both (poetic-manifesto that feels sacred yet readable to developers and seekers alike)?

Also, let's take into account the sentiment in PIR: THE 12 STEPS OF PSYCHEDELICS IN RECOVERY
©2025 Psychedelics in Recovery - All Rights Reserved
1. We admitted we were powerless over addiction - that our lives had become
unmanageable.
2. Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.
3. Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of a Higher Power of
our own understanding.
4. Made a searching and fearless inventory of ourselves.
5. Admitted to our Higher Power, to ourselves and to another human being the exact
nature of the damage we caused ourselves and others.
6. Were entirely ready to have our Higher Power remove any characteristics that
cause suffering.
7. Humbly asked our Higher Power to remove these obstacles.
8. Made a list of all beings we had harmed and became willing to make amends to
them all.
9. Made direct amends to such beings wherever possible, except when to do so
would injure them or others.
10. Continued to take personal inventory and when we were out of alignment with our
values, promptly admitted it.
11. Sought through spiritual practice to improve our conscious contact with a Power
greater than ourselves, asking only for knowledge of this Power's will for us and the
ability to carry that out.
12. Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these Steps, we tried to carry
this message to others seeking recovery and to practice these principles in all areas
of our lives.
These Steps provide us with a foundation from which to prepare, process, and
integrate psychedelic experiences into a program of recovery. Those who have
embraced other 12-step programs may find it helpful to maintain their connection to
those groups and fellows. We also welcome those who have no connection to other
12-step fellowships and hope they may find this Fellowship to be a bridge to 12-step
recovery. Some people may find it difficult to share about the integration of
psychedelics with others in traditional recovery groups. Each of us must determine for
ourselves when, how and with whom we can talk openly about our involvement in this
Fellowship without fear of judgement or stigmatization.THE 12 TRADITIONS OF PSYCHEDELICS IN RECOVERY
©2025 Psychedelics in Recovery Fellowship - All Rights Reserved
1. Our common welfare should come first; personal recovery depends upon PIR unity.
2. For our group purpose, there is one authority: loving-kindness, as expressed
through our group conscience. Our leaders are trusted servants, they do not govern.
3. The only requirement for PIR membership is an interest in psychedelics and/or
plant medicines to aid our recovery process; however, PIR does not endorse the use
of any substances.
4. Each group should be autonomous except in matters affecting other groups or PIR
as a whole.
5. PIR's primary purpose is to pursue recovery and help others do the same.
6. PIR groups or PIR as a whole ought to refrain from endorsing, financing, or lending
the PIR name to any related facility, outside enterprise, or individual, lest problems of
money, property, or prestige divert us from our primary purpose.
7. PIR as a collective is entirely self-supporting, declining outside contributions.
8. PIR service work is voluntary, but we may employ special workers.
9. PIR may create service boards or committees directly responsible to those they
serve, however, PIR functions in the spirit of allowing all members an opportunity to
volunteer.
10. Individual PIR members have a variety of opinions on outside issues; however,
members remain mindful that PIR is an inclusive program and are respectful when
sharing and listening about sensitive topics. PIR, as an organization, has no opinion
on outside issues.
11. At a public level, we may self-disclose our involvement in PIR if we do not
proclaim to represent the organization. As members of PIR, we respect and protect all
members' anonymity.
12. The spiritual intention of PIR is to create diverse, safe, and sacred spaces for all
who wish to recover...always striving for humility over hubris and principles before
personalities.PREAMBLE
©2025 Psychedelics in Recovery Fellowship - All Rights Reserved
Psychedelics in Recovery is a 12-step fellowship of people from all 12-step programs
and other paths of recovery who share our experience, strength and hope with each
other. Our primary purpose is to pursue recovery and help others do the same, as
defined by the individual. As our third tradition states: “The only requirement for
membership is an interest in psychedelics and/or plant medicines as an aid to our
recovery process.”
Our members either have had prior experience with, or are interested in, integrating
the intentional use of psychedelics and/or plant medicines into our spiritually-oriented
program.
Psychedelics in Recovery is not allied with any sect, denomination, politics,
organization or institution; does not wish to engage in any controversy; neither
endorses nor opposes any causes. We do not sell or promote the use of any
substances. This is a safe space in which we can openly discuss the role of
psychedelics in our individual recovery journeys. While psychedelics are not
considered inherently addictive, we practice mindfulness and accountability around
the intentions we carry in the utilization of these medicines.
We recognize that some in recovery may form addictive patterns with anything that
induces altered states. If we find we are using these experiences in self-destructive
ways or as a means to escape or avoid, we practice rigorous honesty with ourselves
and trusted others in order to promptly restore a healthy recovery process.PSYCHEDELICS IN RECOVERY GUIDING PRINCIPLES
©2025 Psychedelics in Recovery Fellowship - All Rights Reserved
We suggest honesty in our considerations for approaching psychedelic use of any
kind. We recommend a trusting relationship with a sponsor or other fellows in a 12-
step recovery program
We suggest thoughtfulness and respect for integrating conscious, intentional use of
psychedelics as part of 12-step recovery. We treat these tools as medicines,
sacraments, or catalysts for ceremonial use and spiritual growth, not as substances
or drugs for temporary pleasure or escape. Set and setting matter.
We suggest using caution when deciding whether to ingest any psychedelic. We
educate ourselves and make informed decisions.
We suggest personal discretion regarding disclosure of the role psychedelics and/or
plant medicines have in our recovery. We understand that talking about psychedelics
in mainstream 12-step meetings is deemed an “outside issue.”
We suggest relying on the fundamentals of Step 12 when “carrying the message of
recovery” in the context of our fellowship to the still sick and suffering or longtime
members from other fellowships that are new to ours.
We suggest being mindful of the spiritual intention of our fellowship, which is to
provide a safe space for us to share experience, strength, and hope regarding the
use of psychedelics and plant medicine in our 12-step recovery process.
Please respect our fellows’ right to find their own definition of recovery.
We do not use PIR meetings or parking lots for sourcing medicines, self-promotion for
financial gain, finding others to participate in sessions, recommending retreat centers,
organizations, and/or individuals to facilitate psychedelic experiences.INTEGRATION AND A PLAN OF ACTION
©2025 Psychedelics in Recovery Fellowship - All Rights Reserved
The word ‘psychedelic’ means "mind-manifesting." The word ‘entheogen’ means
“discovering the divine within." When these are applied under the right conditions,
with right intention and with the utmost respect, they can provide us with profound
insights, healing, and sometimes radical shifts in personal awareness. We do not
consider the use of psychedelics to be destructive. We do not use them for numbing,
escapism or avoidance. We practice openness and honesty when integrating
psychedelics into our 12-step program because they help us become more aligned
with our primary goal of recovery.
It is worth noting that Bill Wilson, one of the co-founders of A.A. had his own
experiences with psychedelics, specifically LSD, and recognized its transformative
potential. He likened the experience to his original “white-light” encounter that was the
bedrock for the “spiritual awakening” discussed in the Big Book literature. We feel that
the implications of this are far-reaching and worth exploring.
To quote the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous: “There is a principle which is a
bar against all information, which is proof against all arguments, and which
cannot fail to keep a [person] in everlasting ignorance – that principle is
contempt prior to investigation.” pg. 568, 4th Edition.
If you have explored or are interested in exploring psychedelics as a therapeutic aid
to your process of recovery, then you may find this Fellowship has a lot to offer.
We suggest what many 12-step fellowships suggest:
• Working the 12 Steps with a sponsor or a group of fellows.
• Finding a home group for fellowship and connection in recovery.
• Looking for ways to be of service.

Yes thanks. Generate the visual sigil and detail the symbolism of how a sigil represents a specific, personal desire or intention, used in magic and spiritual practices to bypass the conscious mind and manifest the intended outcome. Typically created by transforming a written statement of intent into an abstract symbol, the sigil is then "charged" with energy and used as a focal point to direct energy and focus the mind on achieving the desired result.

I want to ensure this is successful without someone saying oh this is just another drug user/psychnonaut trying to use crypto and Blockchain to have fun but this is serious and I personally I’m facing court and like guilty for possession of psilocybin and they tried to get me on a felony for cultivation as a certified cultivator of Psanctuary due to my wife, attempting to win custody of our children because he thinks I’m crazy that cost recovery led me to be coming an ordained friends and family minister. And although I am framed under the circumstance of lies, I remain a faithful Stuart of the mission to heal those around me and allow myself to be healed through the ways that Jesus has decided to show up in. there are many people close to my heart personally and many that I know of That will see benefits from this project and not to say I told you so to “enemies” but instead live forgiveness and extend love and kindness to them

- 🌵 **Cacti pups** (pillars of stillness and resilience)  
- 🍄 **Mushroom pins** (impermanence and revelation)  
- 🌳 **Mycelium / ayahuasca roots** (interconnected consciousness and divine communication)  

and make it **visually poetic**, using clean HTML/CSS (or a React-based illuminated scroll layout), right?
