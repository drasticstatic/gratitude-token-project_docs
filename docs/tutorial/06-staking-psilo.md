# Staking PSILO for MDAO

Learn how to **stake PSILO tokens** to earn MDAO governance tokens and participate in DAO decision-making.

## üéØ What is Staking?

**Staking** is locking your PSILO tokens in a smart contract to earn MDAO rewards.

**How it works:**
1. You deposit PSILO into staking contract
2. PSILO is locked (can't transfer while staked)
3. You earn MDAO tokens over time
4. You can unstake anytime (get PSILO back)
5. MDAO gives you voting power in the DAO

**Example:**
- Stake: 10,000 PSILO
- Base rate: 0.1 MDAO per PSILO per year
- Time multiplier: 2x (held 1+ year)
- Annual earnings: 2,000 MDAO
- **APY: 20% in MDAO**

## üéØ Why Stake PSILO?

### Benefits

**‚úÖ Earn MDAO:**
- Governance tokens
- Voting power
- Influence protocol decisions

**‚úÖ Time Multiplier:**
- Longer you stake = higher rewards
- Up to 5x multiplier
- Rewards patience

**‚úÖ Support the Project:**
- Reduces circulating supply
- Shows long-term commitment
- Aligns incentives

**‚úÖ Passive Income:**
- Earn while you sleep
- Compounding possible
- No active management

### Risks

**‚ö†Ô∏è Locked Tokens:**
- Can't sell while staked
- Must unstake first
- Price could drop

**‚ö†Ô∏è Opportunity Cost:**
- Could use PSILO elsewhere
- Liquidity provision might earn more
- Trading opportunities missed

**‚ö†Ô∏è MDAO Price Risk:**
- MDAO value can fluctuate
- APY in MDAO, not USD
- No guaranteed dollar value

## üìã Prerequisites

Before staking:

- ‚úÖ **PSILO Tokens** - In your wallet
- ‚úÖ **ETH for Gas** - ~0.005 ETH for transactions

## üîí Step-by-Step Staking Guide

### Step 1: Access Staking Interface

1. Visit [etherealoffering.org](https://etherealoffering.org)
2. Click **"Stake"** in navigation
3. Ensure wallet is connected
4. You'll see the staking dashboard

### Step 2: Review Staking Stats

**Check the information:**

**Global Stats:**
- Total PSILO staked
- Total MDAO distributed
- Current APY
- Number of stakers

**Your Stats:**
- PSILO balance (available to stake)
- Current stake (if any)
- MDAO earned
- Time multiplier

**Example:**
```
Global Staking Stats

Total Staked: 5,000,000 PSILO (50% of supply)
Total MDAO Distributed: 250,000 MDAO
Current APY: 10-50% (depends on multiplier)
Active Stakers: 1,234

Your Stats

Available: 10,000 PSILO
Currently Staked: 0 PSILO
MDAO Earned: 0
Time Multiplier: 1x (new staker)
```

### Step 3: Enter Stake Amount

**Choose how much to stake:**

**Options:**
- Enter specific amount
- Click "25%" / "50%" / "75%" / "Max"
- Leave some PSILO for liquidity

**Considerations:**
- How much can you lock up?
- Do you need liquidity?
- What's your time horizon?

**Example:**
- Total PSILO: 10,000
- Stake: 7,500 (75%)
- Keep: 2,500 (for liquidity/trading)

### Step 4: Review Staking Details

**Check the details:**

**Staking Info:**
- Amount to stake
- Current APY
- Estimated MDAO per year
- Time multiplier
- Unstaking period (if any)

**Example:**
```
Stake 7,500 PSILO

Base Rate: 0.1 MDAO per PSILO per year
Time Multiplier: 1x (new staker)
Estimated Earnings: 750 MDAO per year
Current APY: 10%

After 1 year: 2x multiplier ‚Üí 1,500 MDAO/year (20% APY)
After 2 years: 3x multiplier ‚Üí 2,250 MDAO/year (30% APY)
After 3 years: 5x multiplier ‚Üí 3,750 MDAO/year (50% APY)
```

### Step 5: Approve PSILO (First Time Only)

**First time staking:**

1. Click **"Approve PSILO"**
2. MetaMask pops up
3. Review approval
4. Click **"Confirm"**
5. Wait for confirmation (~15 seconds)

**Note:** Only needed once.

### Step 6: Stake PSILO

**Now you're ready:**

1. Click **"Stake"**
2. MetaMask pops up
3. Review transaction
4. Confirm
5. Wait for confirmation (~30 seconds)

### Step 7: Confirm Success

**After confirmation:**

‚úÖ **PSILO Staked** - Tokens locked in contract  
‚úÖ **Earning MDAO** - Rewards accruing  
‚úÖ **Position Active** - Shows on dashboard

**Verify:**
- Staked amount correct
- MDAO earning rate shown
- Time multiplier displayed

## üìà Time Multiplier System

### How It Works

**The longer you stake, the more you earn:**

| Time Staked | Multiplier | Effective APY |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|
| 0-6 months | 0.5x | 5% |
| 6-12 months | 1x | 10% |
| 1-2 years | 2x | 20% |
| 2-3 years | 3x | 30% |
| 3+ years | 5x | 50% |

**Example:**
- Stake: 10,000 PSILO
- Base rate: 0.1 MDAO per PSILO per year

**Year 1:**
- Multiplier: 0.5x ‚Üí 1x (average 0.75x)
- Earnings: 750 MDAO

**Year 2:**
- Multiplier: 1x ‚Üí 2x (average 1.5x)
- Earnings: 1,500 MDAO

**Year 3:**
- Multiplier: 2x ‚Üí 3x (average 2.5x)
- Earnings: 2,500 MDAO

**Year 4+:**
- Multiplier: 5x
- Earnings: 5,000 MDAO per year

**Total after 4 years: 9,750 MDAO**

### Multiplier Resets

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:**

**If you unstake:**
- Multiplier resets to 0.5x
- Must rebuild over time
- Lose accumulated multiplier

**If you add more PSILO:**
- Multiplier stays the same
- New PSILO starts at 0.5x
- Weighted average multiplier

**Example:**
- Staked 1 year: 10,000 PSILO at 1x multiplier
- Add 10,000 PSILO (new stake at 0.5x)
- New average: 20,000 PSILO at 0.75x multiplier

## üí∞ Claiming MDAO Rewards

### How Rewards Accrue

**MDAO is earned continuously:**
- Every block (~12 seconds)
- Proportional to stake
- Multiplied by time multiplier
- Automatically calculated

**Example:**
- Stake: 10,000 PSILO
- Multiplier: 2x
- Rate: 0.1 MDAO per PSILO per year
- Per year: 2,000 MDAO
- Per day: 5.48 MDAO
- Per hour: 0.228 MDAO
- Per block: 0.00076 MDAO

### Claiming Process

**Two options:**

**Option 1: Manual Claim**
1. Go to staking dashboard
2. See "Unclaimed MDAO"
3. Click **"Claim MDAO"**
4. Confirm transaction
5. MDAO sent to wallet

**Option 2: Auto-Compound (Future)**
- Automatically stake MDAO
- Earn more voting power
- No manual claiming needed

**Gas costs:**
- Claiming costs gas (~$2-$10)
- Consider batching claims
- Claim monthly or quarterly

## üîì Unstaking PSILO

### When to Unstake

**Good reasons:**
- Need the funds
- Better opportunity elsewhere
- Achieved your goals
- Exiting the project

**Bad reasons:**
- Panic (temporary price drop)
- Impatience (multiplier needs time)
- FOMO (chasing other projects)

### Unstaking Process

**Step-by-step:**

1. Go to staking dashboard
2. Click **"Unstake"**
3. Enter amount (or click "Max")
4. Review details
5. Click **"Unstake PSILO"**
6. Confirm in MetaMask
7. Wait for confirmation

**You receive:**
- Your PSILO back
- Any unclaimed MDAO
- Multiplier resets

**Example:**
- Unstake: 7,500 PSILO
- Unclaimed MDAO: 150
- Receive: 7,500 PSILO + 150 MDAO
- Multiplier: Resets to 0.5x

### Partial Unstaking

**You can unstake partially:**

**Example:**
- Staked: 10,000 PSILO
- Unstake: 2,500 PSILO (25%)
- Remaining: 7,500 PSILO
- Multiplier: Stays the same for remaining stake

**Use cases:**
- Need some liquidity
- Rebalance portfolio
- Take profits
- Reduce exposure
