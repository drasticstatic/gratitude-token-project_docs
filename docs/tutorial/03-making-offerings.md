# Making Ceremonial Offerings

Learn how to use the **Sacred Altar** to make ceremonial token burns and receive Proof of Burn NFTs.

## üî• What is a Ceremonial Offering?

A ceremonial offering is the act of **permanently burning ETHO tokens** as a spiritual practice. It's inspired by ancient burnt offering traditions where material goods were offered to the divine through fire.

**When you make an offering:**
1. **ETHO tokens are burned** - Permanently removed from circulation
2. **ETH donation to treasury** - Funds the mission
3. **POB NFT is minted** - Soulbound receipt of your offering
4. **Intention is recorded** - Your prayer/intention stored on-chain
5. **MDAO is earned** - Governance tokens as reward

---

## üìã Prerequisites

Before making an offering, ensure you have:

- ‚úÖ **ETHO Tokens** - The ceremonial burn token
- ‚úÖ **ETH for Donation** - Minimum 0.001 ETH (~$2)
- ‚úÖ **ETH for Gas** - ~0.001 ETH for transaction fee
- ‚úÖ **Wallet Connected** - Connected to the dApp

### Getting ETHO

If you don't have ETHO yet:

1. **Swap on AMM** - Trade other tokens for ETHO
2. **Earn Through Participation** - Daily check-ins, ceremonies
3. **Convert from DM** - Swap daily rewards for ETHO
4. **Purchase** - Buy from marketplace

**See:** [ETHO Token Documentation](/docs/tokenomics/etho-token)

## üî• Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Choose Offering Amount

Decide how much ETHO to burn:

**Suggested Amounts:**
- **Small Offering** - 10-99 ETHO (~$0.50-$5)
- **Medium Offering** - 100-999 ETHO (~$5-$50)
- **Large Offering** - 1,000-9,999 ETHO (~$50-$500)
- **Mega Offering** - 10,000+ ETHO ($500+)

**Considerations:**
- What can you afford?
- What feels meaningful?
- Are you building a streak?
- Is there a special occasion?

### Step 2: Set Your Intention

Write a prayer, intention, or reflection:

**Examples:**
- "Gratitude for my sobriety"
- "Releasing attachment to outcomes"
- "In memory of [name]"
- "For the healing of the community"
- "Surrendering my will"

**Privacy:**
- Intentions are **encrypted** on-chain
- Only you can decrypt and read them
- Community sees that you made an offering, not the intention
- Optional - you can leave blank

**Character Limit:** 32 bytes (about 32 characters)

### Step 3: Choose ETH Donation

Decide how much ETH to donate to the treasury:

**Minimum:** 0.001 ETH (~$2)  
**Suggested:** 1-5% of ETHO value

**Example:**
- Burning 1,000 ETHO ($50 value)
- Suggested donation: $0.50-$2.50 (0.00025-0.00125 ETH)

**Where it goes:**
- 100% to DAO treasury
- Funds development, security, community programs
- Transparent on-chain

### Step 4: Review Rewards

See what you'll earn:

**MDAO Rewards:**
- Based on offering size
- Bonus for streaks
- Extra on special days (new moon, full moon, etc.)

**POB NFT:**
- Rarity based on amount
- Unique artwork generated
- Soulbound (can't transfer)
- Permanent record

**Example:**
- Burn: 500 ETHO
- Earn: 25 MDAO (base) + 5 MDAO (7-day streak) = 30 MDAO
- POB: Uncommon rarity

## üí° Tips & Best Practices

### Building a Streak

**Tips for consistency:**
- Set a daily reminder
- Make small offerings (affordable)
- Pair with existing habit (morning coffee, evening meditation)
- Join accountability group on Discord
- Track on calendar

**If you miss a day:**
- Streak resets to 0
- But your total offerings and MDAO remain
- Start building again immediately
- Don't let one miss discourage you

### Meaningful Offerings

**Make it sacred:**
- Create a ritual (light candle, play music)
- Take a moment of silence
- Write thoughtful intention
- Reflect on what you're releasing
- Express gratitude

**It's not about the amount‚Äîit's about the intention.**

### Managing Costs

**Stay sustainable:**
- Start small (10-50 ETHO)
- Increase gradually
- Don't burn more than you can afford
- Remember: consistency > size
- Use DM earnings to buy ETHO

### Community Connection

**Share your journey:**
- Post in Discord #offerings channel
- Share milestones (100th offering, 1-year streak)
- Support others' journeys
- Celebrate together
- Learn from the community

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations

### Irreversibility

**Burned tokens are gone forever:**
- Cannot be undone
- Cannot be refunded
- Make sure you're ready
- Double-check amounts

### Not an Investment

**Offerings are spiritual practice, not investment:**
- Don't expect financial return
- MDAO has value, but that's not the point
- Focus on the spiritual benefit
- Release attachment to outcomes

### Gas Fees

**Remember to account for gas:**
- Ethereum gas fees vary ($1-$50)
- Check gas prices before offering
- Consider using DM for gas (coming soon)
- Batch offerings during low-gas times

## üôè Closing Reflection

*"The burnt offering teaches surrender. The feast teaches gratitude. Together they are worship: a life offered, a world received."*

Making an offering is not a transaction‚Äîit's a **transformation**. You're not just burning tokens; you're releasing attachment, expressing gratitude, and participating in something sacred.

**Every offering matters.** Whether it's 10 ETHO or 10,000 ETHO, what counts is the intention behind it.

**Welcome to the altar.** üî•‚ú®
