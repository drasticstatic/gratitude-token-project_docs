# Getting Started with Ethereal Offering

Welcome to the **Ethereal Offering dApp**! This tutorial will guide you through everything you need to know to participate in our sacred blockchain ecosystem.

## üéØ What You'll Learn

By the end of this tutorial series, you'll be able to:

- Connect your Web3 wallet to the dApp
- Purchase PSILO tokens in the crowdsale
- Stake tokens to earn governance rights
- Make ceremonial token burns
- Mint and breed Mushroom NFTs
- Participate in DAO governance
- Trade on the AMM (Automated Market Maker)

## üìã Prerequisites

### 1. Web3 Wallet

You'll need a Web3 wallet to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. We recommend:

- **MetaMask** (Browser extension) - [Install MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)
- **Rainbow Wallet** (Mobile & Desktop) - [Get Rainbow](https://rainbow.me/)
- **Coinbase Wallet** (Mobile & Browser) - [Download Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet)

### 2. ETH for Gas Fees

You'll need some ETH in your wallet to pay for transaction fees (gas). Even small amounts work:

- **Minimum recommended**: 0.01 ETH (~$20-40 depending on gas prices)
- **Comfortable amount**: 0.05 ETH (~$100-200)

### 3. Test Network (Optional)

For learning and testing, we recommend using the **Sepolia testnet**:

- Get free test ETH from [Sepolia Faucet](https://sepoliafaucet.com/)
- Switch your wallet to Sepolia network
- Practice without risking real funds

## üåê Accessing the dApp

### Production (Mainnet)
Visit: **https://etherealoffering.org** (Coming Soon)

### Testnet (Sepolia)
Visit: **https://testnet.etherealoffering.org** (Available Now)

### Local Development
If you're running locally:
```bash
npm start
# Opens http://localhost:3000
```

## üîå Connecting Your Wallet

### Step 1: Click "Connect Wallet"

When you first visit the dApp, you'll see a **"Connect Wallet"** button in the top right corner.

### Step 2: Choose Your Wallet

A modal will appear showing available wallet options:
- MetaMask
- WalletConnect (for mobile wallets)
- Coinbase Wallet
- Rainbow
- And more...

### Step 3: Approve the Connection

Your wallet will ask you to approve the connection. This is safe - it only allows the dApp to:
- View your wallet address
- Request transactions (which you must approve individually)

**The dApp CANNOT:**
- Access your private keys
- Make transactions without your approval
- Spend your funds automatically

### Step 4: Verify Connection

Once connected, you'll see:
- Your wallet address (shortened, like `0x1234...5678`)
- Your ETH balance
- A unique pseudonym generated from your address

## üé® Understanding the Interface

### Navigation Bar

- **Home** - Landing page with project overview
- **Altar** - Make ceremonial token burns
- **Farm** - Grow and harvest Mushroom NFTs
- **Swap** - Trade tokens on the AMM
- **DAO** - Participate in governance
- **Crowdsale** - Purchase PSILO tokens

### Your Profile Section

Click your wallet address to see:
- **Balances** - All your token balances (PSILO, MDAO, ETHO, PSD, DM)
- **NFTs** - Your Mushroom NFTs and Proof of Burn NFTs
- **Activity** - Recent transactions
- **Settings** - Preferences and network selection

### Network Indicator

Always check which network you're on:
- üü¢ **Green** = Correct network (Ethereum Mainnet or Sepolia)
- üî¥ **Red** = Wrong network (click to switch)

## üîê Security Best Practices

### Protect Your Seed Phrase

Your wallet's seed phrase (12-24 words) is the **master key** to your funds:

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Write it down on paper
- Store it in a safe place
- Never share it with anyone
- Keep multiple backups in secure locations

‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Take screenshots
- Store in cloud services
- Share with "support" (we'll never ask)
- Enter it on websites

### Verify Transactions

Before approving any transaction:

1. **Check the recipient address** - Make sure it's correct
2. **Verify the amount** - Confirm you're sending what you intend
3. **Review gas fees** - Understand the cost
4. **Read the function** - Know what the transaction does

### Beware of Scams

Common scams to avoid:

- **Fake websites** - Always check the URL
- **Phishing emails** - We'll never email asking for your seed phrase
- **Impersonators** - Verify official channels (Discord, Twitter)
- **Too good to be true** - If it sounds impossible, it probably is
