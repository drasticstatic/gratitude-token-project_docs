# Providing Liquidity

Learn how to become a **Liquidity Provider (LP)** and earn fees by supplying tokens to the AMM pools.

## üíß What is Liquidity Provision?

**Liquidity Providers** deposit token pairs into pools to enable trading.

**How it works:**
1. You deposit equal value of two tokens (e.g., 1,000 ETHO + 50 PSD)
2. You receive LP tokens representing your share
3. Traders swap against your liquidity
4. You earn 0.3% fee on every swap
5. You can withdraw anytime (burn LP tokens, get tokens back)

**Example:**
- Pool: 10,000 ETHO / 500 PSD
- You add: 1,000 ETHO / 50 PSD (10% of pool)
- You receive: 10% of LP tokens
- Traders swap: $10,000 volume per day
- Fees generated: $30 per day (0.3%)
- Your share: $3 per day (10%)
- **Annual yield: ~22% APY**

## üíß Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Choose a Pool

**Available pools:**

| Pool | APY | Risk | Recommended For |
|------|-----|------|----------------|
| **ETHO/PSD** | 15-25% | Low | Beginners |
| **PSILO/ETH** | 20-40% | Medium | Experienced |
| **MDAO/PSD** | 10-20% | Low | Conservative |
| **DM/PSD** | 25-50% | Medium | Active users |

**Factors to consider:**
- **APY** - Higher = more fees, but often more risk
- **Volatility** - Stable pairs = less impermanent loss
- **Volume** - Higher volume = more fees
- **Your holdings** - Use tokens you already have

### Step 2: Calculate Amounts

**You need equal VALUE of both tokens:**

**Example:**
- ETHO price: $0.05
- PSD price: $1.00
- You want to provide $100 total

**Calculation:**
- $50 in ETHO: 1,000 ETHO
- $50 in PSD: 50 PSD
- **Total: 1,000 ETHO + 50 PSD**

**Use the calculator** on the liquidity page to auto-calculate.

### Step 3: Access Liquidity Interface

1. Visit [etherealoffering.org](https://etherealoffering.org)
2. Click **"Liquidity"** in navigation
3. Click **"Add Liquidity"**
4. Select pool (e.g., ETHO/PSD)

### Step 4: Enter Amounts

**Two ways:**

**Option A: Enter one amount**
- Type amount of first token
- Second amount auto-calculates
- Maintains correct ratio

**Option B: Use max**
- Click "Max" on one token
- Other amount auto-calculates
- Uses all available balance

**Example:**
- Enter: 1,000 ETHO
- Auto-calculates: 50 PSD
- Ratio: 20:1 (current pool ratio)

### Step 5: Review Details

**Check the information:**

**Pool Share:**
- Your percentage of pool
- Current pool size
- Your contribution

**LP Tokens:**
- How many LP tokens you'll receive
- Represents your share
- Needed to withdraw

**Rates:**
- Current exchange rate
- Your average entry price
- Pool composition

**Example:**
```
Add Liquidity to ETHO/PSD

You're adding:
- 1,000 ETHO ($50)
- 50 PSD ($50)
- Total: $100

Pool share: 2.5%
LP tokens: 250
Current rate: 1 ETHO = 0.05 PSD
```

### Step 6: Approve Tokens

**First time providing liquidity:**

1. Click **"Approve ETHO"**
2. Confirm in MetaMask
3. Wait for confirmation
4. Click **"Approve PSD"**
5. Confirm in MetaMask
6. Wait for confirmation

**Note:** Only needed once per token.

### Step 7: Add Liquidity

**Now you're ready:**

1. Click **"Add Liquidity"**
2. MetaMask pops up
3. Review transaction
4. Confirm
5. Wait for confirmation (~30 seconds)

### Step 8: Receive LP Tokens

**After confirmation:**

‚úÖ **LP Tokens Minted** - Check your wallet  
‚úÖ **Tokens Deposited** - ETHO and PSD transferred to pool  
‚úÖ **Position Active** - You're now earning fees!

**Verify:**
- LP tokens in wallet
- Position shows on liquidity page
- Pool share percentage correct

## üí∞ Earning Fees

### How Fees Work

**Every swap generates fees:**

**Example:**
- Trader swaps 100 ETHO for PSD
- Swap fee: 0.3% = 0.3 ETHO
- Fee distributed to all LPs proportionally
- You own 2.5% of pool
- You earn: 0.0075 ETHO

**Fees compound:**
- Fees added to pool
- Your share grows
- No action needed
- Automatic compounding

### Calculating Returns

**APY depends on:**
1. **Trading Volume** - More swaps = more fees
2. **Pool Size** - Smaller pool = higher APY per LP
3. **Your Share** - Larger share = more fees

**Example calculation:**
- Pool: $10,000 TVL
- Daily volume: $5,000
- Daily fees: $15 (0.3% of $5,000)
- Annual fees: $5,475
- **APY: 54.75%**

**Your earnings:**
- Your share: 2.5% ($250 in pool)
- Your annual fees: $136.88 (2.5% of $5,475)
- **Your APY: 54.75%**

### Tracking Earnings

**View your stats:**

1. Go to **"Liquidity"** ‚Üí **"Your Positions"**
2. See:
   - Current value
   - Fees earned
   - APY
   - Impermanent loss
   - Pool share

**Example:**
```
Your ETHO/PSD Position

Deposited: $100 (1,000 ETHO + 50 PSD)
Current Value: $105
Fees Earned: $5
Impermanent Loss: $0
APY: 54.75%
Pool Share: 2.5%
```

## üìä Understanding Impermanent Loss

### What is Impermanent Loss?

**IL occurs when token prices diverge:**

**Example:**
- You deposit: 1,000 ETHO ($50) + 50 PSD ($50)
- ETHO price doubles to $0.10
- Pool rebalances: 707 ETHO ($70.70) + 70.7 PSD ($70.70)
- Your value: $141.40
- If you just held: 1,000 ETHO ($100) + 50 PSD ($50) = $150
- **Impermanent Loss: $8.60 (5.7%)**

**Why "impermanent"?**
- If price returns to original, IL disappears
- If you withdraw, IL becomes permanent
- Fees can offset IL

### IL Calculator

**Use our calculator:**

1. Enter initial deposit
2. Enter price change
3. See IL amount
4. Compare to fees earned

**Example:**
- Deposit: $100
- ETHO price +100%
- IL: -5.7% ($5.70)
- Fees earned: +10% ($10)
- **Net gain: +4.3% ($4.30)**

### Minimizing IL

**Strategies:**

**1. Choose Stable Pairs**
- ETHO/PSD (one stable)
- PSD/USDC (both stable)
- Less price divergence

**2. Provide Long-Term**
- Fees compound over time
- Can offset IL
- Price may revert

**3. Monitor Positions**
- Check IL regularly
- Withdraw if IL too high
- Rebalance if needed

**4. Diversify**
- Multiple pools
- Different risk levels
- Spread exposure

## üîÑ Withdrawing Liquidity

### When to Withdraw

**Good reasons:**
- Need the funds
- IL too high
- Better opportunity elsewhere
- Pool APY dropped

**Bad reasons:**
- Panic (temporary price drop)
- Impatience (fees need time)
- FOMO (chasing higher APY)

### How to Withdraw

**Step-by-step:**

1. Go to **"Liquidity"** ‚Üí **"Your Positions"**
2. Click **"Remove"** on position
3. Choose amount (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)
4. Review amounts you'll receive
5. Click **"Remove Liquidity"**
6. Confirm in MetaMask
7. Wait for confirmation

**You receive:**
- Your share of pool tokens
- Includes fees earned
- Proportional to LP tokens burned

**Example:**
- You remove 100% of position
- Burn: 250 LP tokens
- Receive: 1,050 ETHO + 52.5 PSD
- Includes: 50 ETHO + 2.5 PSD in fees

## üí° Advanced Strategies

### Strategy 1: Range Provision (Future)

**Concentrated liquidity:**
- Provide liquidity in specific price range
- Higher capital efficiency
- More fees per dollar
- Higher IL risk

**Example:**
- ETHO price: $0.05
- Provide liquidity: $0.04-$0.06 range
- 5x more fees than full range
- But IL if price exits range

**Note:** Coming in future upgrade (Uniswap V3 style).

### Strategy 2: Yield Farming

**Earn additional rewards:**
- Provide liquidity
- Stake LP tokens
- Earn DM rewards
- Double dipping!

**Example:**
- Provide ETHO/PSD liquidity
- Earn 20% APY in fees
- Stake LP tokens
- Earn 15% APY in DM
- **Total: 35% APY**

### Strategy 3: Rebalancing

**Manage IL actively:**
- Monitor price changes
- Withdraw if price diverges
- Rebalance manually
- Re-provide liquidity

**Example:**
- ETHO price doubles
- Withdraw liquidity
- Sell some ETHO for PSD
- Re-provide at new ratio
- Lock in gains
