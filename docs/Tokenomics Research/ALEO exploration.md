<!-- 
This document explores the integration of Aleo, a privacy-first blockchain platform, into an existing EVM-based development roadmap. It provides a detailed overview of Aleo's capabilities, particularly its use of zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs for privacy-preserving applications. Key topics include:

1. **Aleo Overview & Resources**: Links to developer documentation, Leo language guides, and industry writeups.
2. **Relevance to Policy Reform & Anonymous Voting**: Use cases such as anonymous voting, protected donor flows, and sensitive DAO processes.
3. **Integration with EVM**: Strategies for complementing Ethereum's governance and treasury logic with Aleo's privacy features.
4. **Data Architecture**: Design considerations for identity anchoring, eligibility checks, and ZK proof handling.
5. **Development Notes**: Steps for learning Leo, designing voting circuits, bridging proofs between Aleo and EVM, and balancing privacy with transparency.
6. **Example Use Cases**: Practical applications like anonymous DAO votes, proof-of-attendance issuance, and ZK-enabled donation receipts.

This document serves as a guide for developers and stakeholders to understand how Aleo can enhance privacy-critical operations while maintaining compatibility with existing Ethereum-based systems.

## Why Aleo is Relevant to Policy Reform & Anonymous Voting

Aleo is purpose-built for privacy-preserving applications using ZK proofs. This makes it a strong match for:

- **Anonymous Voting**  
    Create vote commitments and ZK proofs that a voter is eligible (SBT/DID-linked) without revealing their choices on-chain.

- **Protected Donor Flows**  
    Allow donations with proof-of-contribution recorded on-chain while preserving personal data privacy.

- **Sensitive DAO Processes**  
    Handle ballots, petitions, and sensitive identities (e.g., ministers, therapists) with zero-knowledge to avoid doxxing or retaliation.

## How Aleo Fits Into Your Existing EVM-First Development Plan

- **Keep EVM for Governance & Treasury Logic Initially**  
    Ethereum is where tooling, multisig, and your early developer mentors are familiar.

- **Prototype Private Voting in Aleo**  
    Build a Leo-based private ballot program that verifies a voter's SBT/DID eligibility and emits a ZK-proof of valid vote casting (not the vote itself). The proof can be submitted to an EVM-side contract (or an Aleo-to-EVM bridge/oracle) to count votes or unlock on-chain actions.

- **Complement, Don’t Replace**  
    Use Aleo for privacy-critical operations (voting, donor anonymity) and Ethereum for transparent treasury flows, large-value settlement, and NFT/market mechanics.

## Data Architecture

- **Identity & SBTs**  
    Anchored on EVM (or DID via Ceramic) for discoverability.

- **Eligibility Checks**  
    Performed in Aleo via ZK circuits using hashed SBT attestations as inputs.

- **Resulting ZK Proofs**  
    Posted on-chain (either Aleo-native or via an oracle that notarizes proofs on EVM), triggering DAO-guarded actions.

## Practical Development Notes & Migration Steps

- **Learn Leo**  
    It’s the canonical language for Aleo. Docs & playground:  
    [https://developer.aleo.org/](https://developer.aleo.org/)  
    [https://docs.leo-lang.org/](https://docs.leo-lang.org/)

- **Design Voting Circuits**  
    Example: Voter proves `hash(SBT + nonce)` is in the eligibility set and that they signed with their wallet. The circuit returns proof-of-valid-vote without exposing voter ID or vote contents.

- **Bridging Proofs**  
    Decide whether to keep vote results on Aleo or prove on EVM via a relayer/oracle that verifies Aleo proofs or posts aggregated results. Aleo’s prover architecture (SnarkVM / Leo) is built for this.

- **Privacy + Transparency Trade-Off**  
    The DAO may choose to reveal aggregate tallies on EVM while preserving per-voter privacy on Aleo.

## Example Aleo Use-Cases for Your Roadmap

- **Anonymous DAO Votes**  
    On sensitive policy reform proposals.

- **Proof-of-Attendance for Recovery Services**  
    Issued privately, then transformed into public SBT with user consent.

- **ZK-Enabled Donation Receipts**  
    Protect identity while proving donation amounts and impact.
