# Tokenomics & Economic Model

## Multi-Token Ecosystem

Ethereal Offering uses a **three-token model** designed to create sustainable value while aligning economic incentives with spiritual practice.

## PSILO Token üçÑ

### Overview
**PSILO** (Psilocybin Sanctuary Illumination Ledger Offering) is the primary utility and governance token of the Ethereal Offering ecosystem.

### Token Specifications
- **Standard**: ERC-20
- **Total Supply**: 1,000,000,000 (1 billion)
- **Decimals**: 18
- **Symbol**: PSILO
- **Contract**: [To be deployed]

### Distribution Breakdown

   - Elect council members
   - Adjust protocol parameters

2. **Staking**
   - Earn LIGHT token rewards
   - Increase governance weight
   - Access premium features
   - Participate in exclusive events

3. **Offerings**

   - Unlock spiritual achievements
   - Gain social status

4. **Ecosystem Access**

### Burn Mechanisms

#### Transaction Burn (2%)
Every PSILO transfer burns 2% of the amount:
```
Transfer 1,000 PSILO:
- Recipient receives: 980 PSILO
- Burned: 20 PSILO
```

**Exceptions** (no burn):
- DEX/CEX trading pairs
- Staking/unstaking
- Treasury operations
- Whitelisted contracts

#### Offering Burn (100%)
When minting PoB NFTs, 100% of PSILO is burned:
```
Mint Gold NFT:
- User burns: 10,000 PSILO
- NFT minted: Living Offering #1234
- PSILO supply: -10,000 permanently
```

#### Quarterly Treasury Burn
DAO votes on burning excess treasury:
```
Q1 2025 Proposal:
- Treasury balance: 50M PSILO
- Proposed burn: 5M PSILO (10%)
- Voting period: 7 days
- If passed: Burned after 48-hour timelock
```

### Deflationary Model

**Target Supply Reduction**:
- Year 1: -10% (900M remaining)
- Year 3: -30% (700M remaining)
- Year 5: -50% (500M remaining)
- Year 10: -70% (300M remaining)

**Burn Rate Projections**:
```
Assumptions:
- 100K active users
- Average 10 transactions/month per user
- 1,000 NFT mints/month
- Quarterly treasury burns

Monthly Burn:
- Transaction burns: 2M PSILO
- NFT mints: 10M PSILO
- Treasury burns: 4M PSILO (quarterly average)
Total: ~16M PSILO/month = 192M/year
```

## LIGHT Token ‚ú®

### Overview
**LIGHT** (Living Illumination Gratitude Harvest Token) is the reward token that represents "spiritual dividends" from ecosystem growth.

### Token Specifications
- **Standard**: ERC-20
- **Total Supply**: Dynamic (minted based on treasury performance)
- **Decimals**: 18
- **Symbol**: LIGHT
- **Contract**: [To be deployed]

### Minting Formula

LIGHT is minted quarterly based on:
```
LIGHT_Minted = (Treasury_Growth_USD * Participation_Rate) / PSILO_Price_USD

Where:
- Treasury_Growth_USD = Current treasury value - Previous quarter value
- Participation_Rate = Active_Stakers / Total_Token_Holders
- PSILO_Price_USD = Chainlink oracle price
```

**Example**:
```
Q1 2025:
- Treasury grew from $1M to $1.5M (+$500K)
- 10,000 active stakers / 50,000 total holders = 20% participation
- PSILO price = $0.10

LIGHT_Minted = ($500,000 * 0.20) / $0.10 = 1,000,000 LIGHT
Distributed to stakers proportionally
```

### Utility Functions

1. **Staking Rewards**
   - Stake LIGHT to earn more LIGHT
   - Compound rewards automatically
   - Boost PSILO staking APY

2. **Conversion**

   - Rate based on treasury backing
   - Minimum 30-day holding period

3. **Premium Access**
   - Pay for exclusive content
   - Access advanced features
   - Priority retreat booking
   - VIP community events

### Burn Mechanisms

- 50% of LIGHT used for conversions is burned
- Quarterly burns based on DAO votes
- Penalty burns from early unstaking

## PoB NFTs üî•

## Comparison to Traditional Models

### vs. Traditional Charity

| Aspect | Traditional | Ethereal Offering |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Transparency | Low (annual reports) | High (real-time on-chain) |
| Donor Control | None | Direct governance |
| Value Return | Zero | Tokens + NFTs + rewards |
| Sustainability | Donation-dependent | Self-sustaining treasury |
| Accountability | Limited | Immutable record |

### vs. Other Crypto Projects

| Aspect | Typical DeFi | Ethereal Offering |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Purpose | Profit maximization | Spiritual + economic alignment |

## Risk Mitigation

### Economic Risks

1. **Token Price Volatility**
   - Mitigation: Treasury diversification, stablecoin reserves
   - Deflationary pressure supports price floor

2. **Low Participation**
   - Mitigation: Gamification, rewards, community building
   - Multiple utility functions drive demand

3. **Regulatory Changes**
   - Mitigation: Legal structure, compliance framework
   - Decentralized governance reduces single point of failure

### Technical Risks

1. **Smart Contract Bugs**
   - Mitigation: Multiple audits, bug bounty, gradual rollout
   - Upgradeable contracts with timelock

2. **Oracle Failures**
   - Mitigation: Multiple oracle sources, fallback mechanisms
   - Manual override for emergencies

## Conclusion

The Ethereal Offering tokenomics model creates a **virtuous cycle**:

1. Users burn PSILO for NFTs ‚Üí Supply decreases
2. Decreased supply ‚Üí Price pressure increases
3. Higher prices ‚Üí Treasury value grows
4. Treasury growth ‚Üí More LIGHT minted
5. LIGHT rewards ‚Üí More staking participation
6. More participation ‚Üí Stronger community
7. Stronger community ‚Üí More offerings
8. **Cycle repeats and amplifies**

This is not a zero-sum game of speculation, but a **positive-sum economy** where individual sacrifice creates collective abundance.
