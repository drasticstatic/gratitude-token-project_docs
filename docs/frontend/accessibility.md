# Accessibility (A11y)

Accessibility is non-negotiable. Everyone should be able to participate.

## Core Practices

- Keyboard navigation everywhere (Tab/Shift+Tab)
- Visible focus rings and skip links
- Sufficient color contrast (WCAG AA minimum)
- ARIA labels for icons and controls

## Motion Sensitivity

- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Offer a toggle to disable decorative effects

## Content

- Write clear, jargon-free labels
- Avoid color as the only signal
- Provide alt text for imagery

## Forms

- Associate labels and inputs
- Describe errors inline and conversationally
- Prevent accidental destructive actions

## Testing

- Screen reader pass (NVDA, VoiceOver)
- Keyboard-only pass
- Color-blindness simulation

Accessible governance is just governance that includes everyone.
