# Front-End Overview

> "Form follows purpose. Interface is ceremony. Code is devotion."

Welcome to the front-end hub for Ethereal Offering. This section documents how the user interface is designed, structured, and powered‚Äîso you can build new experiences quickly and confidently.

## Goals

- Create a coherent, beautiful UI for sacred governance and offerings
- Encourage participation and clarity through simplicity
- Ensure safety, accessibility, and interoperability
- Be a living portal for community storytelling and coordination

## What You'll Find Here

- Architecture and design principles
- Component catalog and patterns
- Web3 integration and wallet flows
- State management patterns
- Network configuration and environment setup
- Testing, security, accessibility, deployment
- Troubleshooting and best practices

## Tech Orientation

- React (functional components, hooks)
- CSS Modules and light utility classes
- Web3 integration via Ethers/Wagmi-style abstractions
- Modular UI primitives and domain components
- Docusaurus for documentation site (this portal)

Note: This docs repo includes a full set of demo components under `docs/src/components/`. These illustrate UI, flows, and content patterns that can be adapted to production.

## Directory Map (Docs UI Components)

- effects: visual layers (mushrooms, spores, mist, sparkles)
- icons: simple, animated SVG icons for navigation and sections
- modals: domain-specific dialogs (Altar, DAO, Treasury, NFTs, etc.)
- pages: example page-level components (Swap, Governance, AltarBurn, Donate)
- ui: foundational UI elements (buttons, cards, layout helpers)

See Components Catalog for details.

## Design Principles

1. Clarity first: sacred work deserves simple, gentle UI
2. Intentional pacing: slow interactions beat frantic clicks
3. Safety by design: clear warnings and confirmations
4. Ritual flow: make ceremonies feel ceremonial
5. Accessibility: contrast, keyboard nav, screen reader support
6. Composability: small parts, well named, reusable

## Front-End Lifecycle

1. Discovery and IA: define the ceremony or flow
2. Prototype quickly using primitives and modals
3. Integrate wallet and network behavior
4. Validate security & privacy implications
5. Ship and observe; iterate with community feedback

## Spiritual-Technical Integration

- Use gentle motion to support the nervous system
- Invite pause before irreversible actions
- Frame governance as communal listening
- Let the visual language reflect humility and grace

You're not just shipping pixels. You're shaping a space where people can gather, discern, and build together. üôè
