## ðŸ”¥ CRITICAL: Test Main dApp Fix

### The Problem (FIXED)
Your deployed site wasn't loading correctly. I've applied the fix!

### What I Fixed
1. âœ… Added `basename={process.env.PUBLIC_URL}` to Router in `src/index.js`
2. âœ… Created `public/404.html` for GitHub Pages routing
3. âœ… Added redirect handler to `public/index.html`

### What You Need to Do

```bash
# 1. Rebuild the app
npm run build

# 2. Redeploy
./deployTest/deployTest.sh 2025-10-10

# 3. Wait 2-3 minutes for GitHub Pages to update

# 4. Test the site
# https://drasticstatic.github.io/gratitude-token-project_testPublish_2025-10-10/
```

### What to Verify
- [ ] Home page loads completely (not just navbar)
- [ ] Clicking home button stays at correct URL
- [ ] All navigation works
- [ ] Refreshing pages works
- [ ] No 404 errors
