# Partnership Overview

## Building the Sacred Economy Together

Ethereal Offering is not an isolated project - we are building a **network of aligned organizations** working together to create infrastructure for sacred community governance, psychedelic integration, and values-based economics.

## Partnership Philosophy

We seek partners who:
- ‚úÖ **Share our values**: Transparency, healing, community, spiritual growth
- ‚úÖ **Serve the mission**: Extend grace and forgiveness into economic structures
- ‚úÖ **Operate ethically**: No exploitation, extraction, or harm
- ‚úÖ **Think long-term**: Building for generations, not quarters
- ‚úÖ **Embrace openness**: Open source, open data, open governance

We avoid partners who:
- ‚ùå Prioritize profit over people
