## üìä Emission Schedule

### Daily Emissions

DM is emitted daily to reward participants:

| Year | Daily Emission | Annual Emission | Total Supply |
|------|---------------|----------------|--------------|
| 1 | 1,000,000 DM | 365M DM | 1.365B |
| 2 | 900,000 DM | 328.5M DM | 1.694B |
| 3 | 810,000 DM | 295.65M DM | 1.989B |
| 4 | 729,000 DM | 266M DM | 2.255B |
| 5 | 656,100 DM | 239.5M DM | 2.494B |

**Emission decreases 10% per year** (deflationary pressure)

### Distribution

Daily emissions are distributed:

- **40%** - Daily check-ins
- **25%** - Ceremonial participation
- **20%** - Liquidity mining
- **10%** - Community engagement
- **5%** - Special events

**Example Day 1:**
- Total emission: 1,000,000 DM
- Check-ins: 400,000 DM (divided among all who checked in)
- Ceremonies: 250,000 DM (divided by offering size)
- Liquidity: 200,000 DM (proportional to LP share)
- Engagement: 100,000 DM (moderator discretion)
- Events: 50,000 DM (special occasions)

## üî• Burn Mechanisms

### What Reduces DM Supply?

DM is burned (permanently destroyed) when:

1. **Gas Fees** - DM used for transactions
2. **Breeding Fees** - DM paid to breed NFTs
3. **Feature Unlocks** - DM spent on premium features
4. **Voluntary Burns** - Users can burn DM for POB NFTs

**Burn Rate:**
- Year 1: ~100M DM burned
- Year 2: ~150M DM burned
- Year 3: ~200M DM burned

**Net Supply:**
- Emissions - Burns = Net Inflation
- Year 1: 365M - 100M = +265M (26.5% inflation)
- Year 2: 328M - 150M = +178M (10.5% inflation)
- Year 3: 295M - 200M = +95M (4.8% inflation)

**Eventually reaches equilibrium** (emissions = burns)

## üí° Economic Design

### Inflationary but Sustainable

DM is intentionally inflationary:

**Why inflation?**
- Rewards ongoing participation
- Prevents hoarding
- Encourages spending/using
- Funds ecosystem growth

**Why sustainable?**
- Decreasing emissions (10% per year)
- Increasing burns (more usage)
- Approaches equilibrium
- Long-term stability

### Value Proposition

DM value comes from:

1. **Utility** - Pay fees, breed NFTs, unlock features
2. **Demand** - Needed for ecosystem participation
3. **Scarcity** - Decreasing emissions over time
4. **Network Effects** - More users = more value

**Not an investment token** - DM is for using, not holding
