# MDAO Token - Governance & Voting

## üó≥Ô∏è Overview

**MDAO** (Mushroom DAO Token) is the **governance token** of the Ethereal Offering ecosystem. It grants holders the power to vote on proposals, shape the future of the platform, and participate in decentralized decision-making.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Symbol** | MDAO |
| **Type** | ERC-20 |
| **Total Supply** | 1,000,000 (1M) |
| **Decimals** | 18 |
| **Supply Model** | Fixed (no minting after deployment) |
| **Primary Use** | DAO governance, voting rights |

---

## üéØ Purpose & Philosophy

### Why Separate Governance Token?

We use a **separate governance token** (MDAO) instead of using PSILO for governance because:

1. **Separation of Concerns** - Fundraising ‚â† Governance
2. **Earned Influence** - Governance is earned through participation, not just purchased
3. **Long-term Alignment** - Stakers are committed to the project's success
4. **Sybil Resistance** - Harder to game the system
5. **Flexibility** - Can adjust governance without affecting fundraising

### Governance Philosophy

**"One token, one vote"** - but tokens must be **earned** through:
- Staking PSILO (commitment)
- Participating in ceremonies (engagement)
- Contributing to the community (service)
- Holding long-term (alignment)

## üíé How to Earn MDAO

### 1. Stake PSILO Tokens

The primary way to earn MDAO is by **staking PSILO**:

```solidity
// Stake PSILO to earn MDAO
function stakePSILO(uint256 amount, uint256 lockPeriod) external {
    // Lock PSILO for 30 days to 4 years
    // Earn MDAO based on amount and duration
}
```

**Earning Rate:**
- **Base Rate:** 0.1 MDAO per PSILO per year (10% APY)
- **Lock Multipliers:**
  - 30 days: 1x (10% APY)
  - 90 days: 1.5x (15% APY)
  - 180 days: 2x (20% APY)
  - 1 year: 3x (30% APY)
  - 2 years: 4x (40% APY)
  - 4 years: 5x (50% APY)

**Example:**
- Stake 10,000 PSILO for 1 year
- Earn: 10,000 √ó 0.1 √ó 3 = 3,000 MDAO
- After 1 year, you have 3,000 MDAO voting power

### 2. Participate in Ceremonies

Earn MDAO by making offerings at the Sacred Altar:

- **Small Offering** (< 100 ETHO): 1 MDAO
- **Medium Offering** (100-1000 ETHO): 10 MDAO
- **Large Offering** (> 1000 ETHO): 50 MDAO
- **Mega Offering** (> 10,000 ETHO): 200 MDAO

**Bonus:** First offering of the month = 2x MDAO

### 3. Community Contributions

Earn MDAO for valuable contributions:

- **Bug Reports:** 10-100 MDAO (based on severity)
- **Code Contributions:** 50-500 MDAO (based on impact)
- **Content Creation:** 25-250 MDAO (blog posts, videos, tutorials)
- **Community Moderation:** 10 MDAO per week
- **Translation:** 100 MDAO per language
- **Partnership Referrals:** 500 MDAO per successful partnership

**How to Claim:**
1. Submit contribution proof to Discord
2. Community votes on reward amount
3. DAO approves payout
4. MDAO sent to your wallet

### 4. NFT Breeding

Earn MDAO by breeding rare Mushroom NFTs:

- **Common Offspring:** 1 MDAO
- **Uncommon Offspring:** 5 MDAO
- **Rare Offspring:** 25 MDAO
- **Epic Offspring:** 100 MDAO
- **Legendary Offspring:** 500 MDAO

**Bonus:** First legendary breed = 1,000 MDAO

### 5. Liquidity Provision

Earn MDAO by providing liquidity to AMM pools:

- **ETHO/PSD Pool:** 5% APY in MDAO
- **PSILO/ETH Pool:** 10% APY in MDAO
- **DM/PSD Pool:** 3% APY in MDAO

**Calculation:**
- Provide $10,000 liquidity to ETHO/PSD
- Earn: $10,000 √ó 5% = $500 worth of MDAO per year
- Plus swap fees (80% to treasury, 20% to LPs)

## üó≥Ô∏è Voting Mechanics

### Voting Power

Your voting power is determined by:

```
Voting Power = MDAO Balance √ó Time Multiplier
```

**Time Multiplier:**
- Held < 1 week: 0.5x
- Held 1-4 weeks: 1x
- Held 1-3 months: 1.5x
- Held 3-6 months: 2x
- Held 6-12 months: 3x
- Held > 12 months: 5x

**Why?** Rewards long-term holders and prevents vote buying.

## üìä Governance Process

### Step 1: Discussion Phase (3-7 days)

2. MDAO holders vote Yes/No/Abstain
3. Votes are weighted by voting power
4. Real-time results visible

### Supply Distribution

```mermaid
pie title MDAO Distribution
    "Staking Rewards (60%)" : 60
    "Ceremony Rewards (15%)" : 15
    "Community Contributions (10%)" : 10
    "Liquidity Mining (10%)" : 10
    "Team & Advisors (5%)" : 5
```

### Emission Schedule

| Year | Annual Emission | Cumulative Supply | % of Total |
|------|----------------|-------------------|-----------|
| 1 | 200,000 | 200,000 | 20% |
| 2 | 150,000 | 350,000 | 35% |
| 3 | 150,000 | 500,000 | 50% |
| 4 | 125,000 | 625,000 | 62.5% |
| 5 | 125,000 | 750,000 | 75% |
| 6-10 | 50,000/year | 1,000,000 | 100% |

**After 10 years, no more MDAO is minted.**

### Value Accrual

MDAO value comes from:

1. **Governance Rights** - Control over treasury and protocol
2. **Revenue Share** - Potential future dividends (requires vote)
3. **Scarcity** - Fixed supply, deflationary pressure
4. **Utility** - Required for proposals and voting
5. **Network Effects** - More users = more value
