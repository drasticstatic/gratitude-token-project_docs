## üéØ Use Cases

### 1. Fundraising
The primary purpose of PSILO is to **raise capital** for:

- **Smart Contract Development** - Audit fees, developer salaries
- **Infrastructure** - Servers, domains, cloud services
- **Marketing** - Community building, partnerships
- **Legal** - Entity formation, compliance
- **Operations** - Day-to-day expenses

### 2. Governance Rights
PSILO holders can **vote on early decisions**:

- Roadmap priorities
- Partnership approvals
- Treasury allocations
- Team hiring

**Note:** For ongoing governance, PSILO can be staked to earn MDAO tokens (see [MDAO Token](/docs/tokenomics/mdao-token)).

### 3. Staking for MDAO
Convert PSILO into governance power:

```solidity
// Stake PSILO to earn MDAO
function stakePSILO(uint256 amount) external {
    // Lock PSILO for 30 days minimum
    // Earn MDAO at rate of 0.1 MDAO per PSILO per year
}
```

**Staking Rewards:**
- **Rate**: 0.1 MDAO per PSILO per year (10% APY in MDAO)
- **Minimum Lock**: 30 days
- **Maximum Lock**: 4 years (4x multiplier)
- **Early Withdrawal**: 25% penalty (goes to treasury)

### 4. Liquidity Provision
Provide liquidity to earn fees:

- **PSILO/ETH Pool** - Primary liquidity pair
- **Fee Share**: 20% of swap fees (80% to treasury)
- **LP Tokens**: Tradeable, stakeable
- **Impermanent Loss**: Risk of price divergence

### 5. Ceremonial Burns
Burn PSILO as an offering:

- **Voluntary Sacrifice** - Reduce circulating supply
- **POB NFT Receipt** - Receive soulbound NFT
- **Treasury Benefit** - Increases value for remaining holders
- **Spiritual Significance** - Act of surrender and trust

## üìà Economic Model

### Supply Dynamics

**Fixed Supply:**
- No new PSILO can ever be minted
- Supply only decreases through burns
- Deflationary pressure over time

**Circulating Supply Schedule:**

| Month | Circulating Supply | % of Total |
|-------|-------------------|-----------|
| 0 (Launch) | 3,000,000 | 30% |
| 3 | 4,500,000 | 45% |
| 6 | 6,500,000 | 65% |
| 12 | 8,500,000 | 85% |
| 24 | 9,500,000 | 95% |
| 36 | 10,000,000 | 100% |

### Price Discovery

**Initial Price:** $0.10 - $0.25 (depending on sale phase)

**Price Drivers:**
- **Demand** - More buyers = higher price
- **Utility** - Staking, governance, burns
- **Scarcity** - Fixed supply + burns
- **Market Sentiment** - Crypto market conditions
- **Project Success** - Adoption and growth

**Price Targets (Speculative):**

| Milestone | Target Price | Market Cap |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| Launch | $0.25 | $2.5M |
| 1,000 Users | $0.50 | $5M |
| 10,000 Users | $1.00 | $10M |
| 100,000 Users | $5.00 | $50M |
| 1M Users | $25.00 | $250M |

**Disclaimer:** These are speculative targets, not guarantees. Crypto markets are volatile. Only invest what you can afford to lose.
