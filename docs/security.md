# Security Best Practices

## üîê Overview

Security is paramount in Web3. This guide covers essential security practices for protecting your wallet, assets, and privacy when using Ethereal Offering.

---

## üîë Wallet Security

### Seed Phrase Protection

Your **seed phrase** (12-24 words) is the master key to your wallet.

**‚úÖ DO:**
- Write it down on paper (never digital)
- Store in a secure location (safe, safety deposit box)
- Make multiple copies (different locations)
- Use a metal backup (fireproof, waterproof)
- Memorize it (if possible)
- Test recovery (on a separate device)

**‚ùå DON'T:**
- Take a photo of it
- Store in cloud (Google Drive, iCloud, etc.)
- Email or text it
- Share with anyone (even "support")
- Store in password manager
- Write it on your computer

**If someone gets your seed phrase, they own your wallet. Forever.**

### Hardware Wallets

**Recommended for large amounts:**

**Ledger Nano X/S:**
- Stores keys offline
- Requires physical confirmation
- Supports Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc.
- ~$79-$149

**Trezor Model T/One:**
- Open-source firmware
- Touchscreen (Model T)
- Multi-currency support
- ~$69-$219

**How to use:**
1. Buy from official website only
2. Set up with new seed phrase
3. Connect to MetaMask
4. Confirm transactions on device
5. Keys never leave device

### Software Wallet Security

**If using MetaMask, Rainbow, etc.:**

**‚úÖ Best Practices:**
- Use strong password (20+ characters)
- Enable biometric lock (Face ID, Touch ID)
- Lock wallet when not in use
- Use separate wallet for large amounts
- Keep browser updated
- Use antivirus software
- Don't install sketchy extensions

**‚ùå Avoid:**
- Weak passwords ("password123")
- Leaving wallet unlocked
- Using same wallet for everything
- Outdated browser
- Pirated software
- Too many browser extensions

## üé£ Scam Prevention

### Common Scams

**1. Phishing Websites**

**How it works:**
- Fake website looks like real one
- You connect wallet
- Malicious contract drains your funds

**How to avoid:**
- Bookmark official site
- Check URL carefully (etherealoffering.org)
- Look for HTTPS and lock icon
- Verify contract addresses
- Use hardware wallet for large transactions

**2. Fake Support**

**How it works:**
- Scammer DMs you pretending to be support
- Asks for seed phrase or private key
- Steals your funds

**How to avoid:**
- **We will NEVER DM you first**
- **We will NEVER ask for seed phrase**
- **We will NEVER ask for private keys**
- Block and report suspicious DMs
- Only ask for help in public channels

**3. Airdrop Scams**

**How it works:**
- "Free tokens" sent to your wallet
- You try to sell them
- Malicious contract drains your wallet

**How to avoid:**
- Don't interact with unknown tokens
- Don't approve unknown contracts
- Use token allowance checker
- Revoke suspicious approvals

**4. Impersonation**

**How it works:**
- Scammer creates fake Twitter/Discord
- Announces fake giveaway
- Asks you to "verify" wallet
- Drains your funds

**How to avoid:**
- Verify official accounts (checkmark)
- Check follower count
- Look for typos in username
- Never "verify" your wallet
- No legitimate giveaway asks for seed phrase

### Red Flags

**üö© Warning signs:**
- Unsolicited DMs
- Urgency ("Act now!")
- Too good to be true
- Asking for seed phrase
- Asking for private key
- Asking to "verify" wallet
- Misspelled URLs
- No HTTPS
- Unverified contracts

**If it feels wrong, it probably is. Trust your gut.**

---

## üîç Transaction Verification

### Before Signing

**Always review:**

1. **Contract Address** - Is it the official contract?
2. **Function** - What is the transaction doing?
3. **Value** - How much ETH are you sending?
4. **Gas Fee** - Is it reasonable?
5. **Token Approvals** - What are you approving?

**Example MetaMask Review:**
```
Contract: 0x1234...abcd (Sacred Altar)
Function: makeOffering
Value: 0.01 ETH (donation)
Gas: 0.002 ETH (~$4)
Approving: 100 ETHO
```

**Questions to ask:**
- Is this the right contract? ‚úÖ
- Do I want to make an offering? ‚úÖ
- Is 0.01 ETH donation correct? ‚úÖ
- Is gas fee reasonable? ‚úÖ
- Am I okay approving 100 ETHO? ‚úÖ

**If anything looks wrong, REJECT the transaction.**

### After Signing

**Verify on Etherscan:**

1. Go to [etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io)
2. Paste transaction hash
3. Check status (Success ‚úÖ or Failed ‚ùå)
4. Review events (OfferingMade, Transfer, etc.)
5. Verify amounts

**Example:**
```
Status: Success ‚úÖ
From: 0xYourAddress
To: 0xSacredAltar
Value: 0.01 ETH
Tokens Transferred:
  - 100 ETHO (burned)
  - 1 POB NFT (minted)
  - 50 MDAO (received)
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Privacy Protection

### Wallet Privacy

**Pseudonymity vs Anonymity:**

**Pseudonymous (default):**
- Wallet address is public
- Transactions are visible
- But not linked to real identity

**Anonymous (advanced):**
- Use Aleo privacy layer (future)
- Zero-knowledge proofs
- Transactions hidden

**Tips for privacy:**
- Use separate wallet for recovery activities
- Don't doxx yourself (link wallet to real name)
- Be careful what you share publicly
- Use VPN when connecting
- Consider Tor for extra privacy

### Data Privacy

**What we collect:**
- Wallet address (public)
- Transaction history (on-chain)
- IP address (server logs)

**What we DON'T collect:**
- Real name
- Email (unless you provide)
- Location (unless you share)
- Seed phrase (never!)
- Private keys (never!)

**Your data rights:**
- Request data deletion
- Opt out of analytics
- Use privacy tools
- Control what you share
