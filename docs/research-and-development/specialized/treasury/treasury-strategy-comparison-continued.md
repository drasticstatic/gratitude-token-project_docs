# Treasury Strategy Comparison (Continued)

Deep dive into allocations and triggers.

## Suggested Mix (Illustrative)

- 40 percent Passive reserves and runway (USDC on Aave)
- 20 percent Index of L2/infra tokens
- 20 percent Mission-aligned grants and investments
- 10 percent Thematic experiments (small bets)
- 10 percent Quant strategies with strict limits

## Triggers & Rebalancing

- Bear markets → Increase passive reserves
- Bull markets → Take profits to runway and grants
- Drawdown > 15 percent → Reduce risk budget
- Surplus > 24 months runway → Increase mission spend

## Reporting

- Monthly on-chain report
- Quarterly narrative + KPI review
- Annual community treasury summit
