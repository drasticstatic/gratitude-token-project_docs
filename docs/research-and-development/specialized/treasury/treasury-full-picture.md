# Treasury — The Full Picture

How value flows, accumulates, and returns to the community.

## Inflows

- Offerings (Proof-of-Burn)
- Transaction fees and staking revenue
- Partner integrations and co-marketing
- Grants and ecosystem rewards

## Outflows

- Scholarships and practitioner funding
- Retreat partnerships and research
- Infrastructure and audits
- Liquidity provisioning and market ops

## Flywheel

1. Participation burns tokens → scarcity increases
2. Scarcity raises token value → treasury grows
3. Treasury funds impact → narrative strengthens
4. Narrative attracts participation → cycle repeats

## Transparency

- Public multi-sig addresses and dashboards
- On-chain proposals and execution receipts
- Independent reporting and community reviews

## Resilience

- Runway targets and stable reserves
- Risk limits and circuit breakers
- Diversified revenue and strategy mix
