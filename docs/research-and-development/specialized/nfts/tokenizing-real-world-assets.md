# Tokenizing Real-World Assets (RWA)

Transform physical and off-chain assets into on-chain primitives that can be owned, governed, financed, and audited transparently.

## Why Tokenize RWA?

- Transparency: Immutable ownership records and programmable rights
- Liquidity: Fractionalize illiquid assets for broader participation
- Efficiency: Automated compliance, settlement, and revenue distribution
- Composability: Plug assets into DeFi, governance, and treasury strategies

## Candidate Assets

- Land stewardship rights and conservation easements
- Retreat center revenue shares and booking capacity
- Equipment and IoT-backed productive assets
- Impact bonds for harm reduction and integration programs
- Intellectual property and curriculum licensing

## Architecture Overview

- Reference NFTs (ERC-721): Represent the asset itself (title, rights, metadata)
- Fractions (ERC-1155 or ERC-20): Represent shares/units or cashflow claims
- Oracles: On-chain attestations of off-chain events (Chainlink, trusted signers)
- Registries: Mapping of asset IDs to compliance status and collateral state
- Vaults: Escrow of revenues to automated distribution contracts

## Compliance & Controls

- Jurisdiction-aware allowlists (KYC/AML when required)
- Transfer restrictions by role or region
- Disclosures and risk factors stored on IPFS/Arweave
- Admin timelocks and multi-sig controls for upgrades

## Data Model (Metadata)

- assetId: Unique ID or title reference
- assetType: Land, equipment, revenueShare, impactBond, IP
- issuer: Entity responsible for reporting
- rights: Usage, revenue share, voting, redemption
- compliance: KYC required, restrictions, disclosures
- oracleFeeds: List of attestors and data endpoints
- impact: KPIs and reporting cadence

## Lifecycle

1. Origination: Due diligence, valuation, disclosures
2. Tokenization: Mint reference NFT + fractional units
3. Distribution: Offer to DAO/partners/community (where legal)
4. Operation: Revenues flow to vaults; KPIs reported by oracles
5. Governance: Token holders vote on upkeep, upgrades, or exit
6. Exit: Buyback, redemption, or secondary markets

## Example: Retreat Center Revenue Share

- Reference NFT: Represents the center’s on-chain identity and rights
- Fractions: ERC-20 "RETREAT-REV" shares representing 10 percent of net revenue
- Vault: Receives USDC from bookings; auto-distributes monthly
- Governance: Token holders approve improvements funded from a treasury pool

## Risks & Mitigations

- Legal uncertainty → Work with counsel; restrict transfers where required
- Oracle risk → Multi-sig attestations, dispute resolution process
- Illiquidity → Redemption windows, market makers, buyback policies
- Governance capture → Quadratic voting, reputation multipliers

## Interoperability

- Bridge to Polygon for low-fee operations
- List fractional tokens on DEXs with curated pools
- Integrate with Treasury DAO for allocation decisions

## Roadmap

- Q1: Legal framework templates + pilot asset
- Q2: Oracle attestation registry and vault distribution module
- Q3: Secondary market and redemption mechanisms
- Q4: Standardized disclosures and impact dashboard
