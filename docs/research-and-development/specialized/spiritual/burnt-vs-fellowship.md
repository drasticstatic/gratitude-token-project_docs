# Burnt vs. Fellowship Offering

Two sacred economic archetypes that shape Ethereal Offeringâ€™s design.

## Burnt Offering

- Total sacrifice: Tokens are destroyed permanently
- Proof of sincerity: Cannot be faked or clawed back
- Spiritual significance: Letting go creates space
- Economic effect: Deflation increases scarcity and aligns long-term value

## Fellowship Offering

- Communal meal: Shared abundance funds common good
- Practical stewardship: Treasury resources used for impact
- Spiritual significance: Participation and belonging
- Economic effect: Liquidity and sustainability for the ecosystem

## Both, Not Either/Or

- Burnt offering proves heart and anchors deflation
- Fellowship offering funds tangible service and growth
- Together they create a balanced, regenerative economy
