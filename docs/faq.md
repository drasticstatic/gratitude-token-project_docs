## üí∞ Token Questions

### How many tokens are there?

**Seven tokens**, each with a specific purpose:

1. **PSILO** - Crowdsale fundraising token
2. **MDAO** - Governance and voting rights
3. **ETHO** - Ceremonial burn token
4. **PSD** - Stablecoin (pegged to $1)
5. **DM** - Daily rewards token
6. **POB** - Proof of Burn NFT (soulbound)
7. **SHROOM** - Mushroom breeding NFT

**See:** [Tokenomics Overview](/docs/tokenomics/overview)

### Which token should I buy first?

**Depends on your goals:**

- **Want to support the project?** ‚Üí Buy PSILO in the crowdsale
- **Want governance rights?** ‚Üí Stake PSILO to earn MDAO
- **Want to make offerings?** ‚Üí Get ETHO (swap or earn)
- **Want price stability?** ‚Üí Use PSD for trading
- **Want daily rewards?** ‚Üí Earn DM through participation

**Recommendation for beginners:** Start with PSILO, then explore others.

### Are these tokens securities?

**No.** We've obtained legal opinions confirming that our tokens are **utility tokens**, not securities under US law. However:

- We're not offering to US residents during the crowdsale (out of abundance of caution)
- Tokens have clear utility within the ecosystem
- No profit promises or guarantees
- Decentralized governance after launch

**Disclaimer:** This is not legal advice. Consult your own attorney.

### What's the total supply of each token?

| Token | Total Supply | Supply Model |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| PSILO | 10,000,000 | Fixed |
| MDAO | 1,000,000 | Fixed |
| ETHO | 100,000,000 | Deflationary (burns) |
| PSD | Elastic | Mints/burns to maintain peg |
| DM | 1,000,000,000 | Inflationary (daily emissions) |
| POB | Unlimited | Minted per offering |
| SHROOM | Unlimited | Minted through breeding |

## üî• Sacred Altar Questions

### What happens when I burn ETHO?

When you make an offering at the Sacred Altar:

1. **ETHO is permanently destroyed** - Removed from circulation forever
2. **POB NFT is minted** - Soulbound receipt of your offering
3. **MDAO is earned** - Governance tokens as reward
4. **ETH goes to treasury** - Funds the mission
5. **Intention is recorded** - Your prayer/intention stored on-chain (encrypted)

**See:** [Making Offerings Tutorial](/docs/tutorial/03-making-offerings)

### Can I get my burned tokens back?

**No.** Burning is **permanent and irreversible**. Once ETHO is burned, it's gone forever. This is by design‚Äîit's a spiritual practice of surrender and release.

**Make sure you're ready before burning!**

### What is a Proof of Burn NFT?

A **POB NFT** is a soulbound (non-transferable) NFT that serves as a permanent receipt of your offering. It includes:

- Unique generative artwork
- Burn amount and date
- Encrypted intention
- Rarity tier (Common to Legendary)
- MDAO earned

**You can view all your POB NFTs in "My NFTs" section.**

### How much should I burn?

**There's no "right" amount.** It depends on:

- What you can afford
- What feels meaningful
- Your spiritual intention
- Whether you're building a streak

**Suggestions:**
- **Beginners:** 10-100 ETHO ($0.50-$5)
- **Regular participants:** 100-1,000 ETHO ($5-$50)
- **Special occasions:** 1,000+ ETHO ($50+)

**Remember:** It's not about the amount‚Äîit's about the intention.

## üôè Recovery & Spiritual Questions

### Do I have to be in recovery to participate?

**No!** Ethereal Offering welcomes everyone:

- People in recovery (any substance/behavior)
- Supporters of recovery
- Spiritual seekers
- Blockchain enthusiasts
- Anyone interested in the mission

**The 12-step integration is optional** - you can participate without engaging with recovery aspects.

### Is this compatible with traditional 12-step programs?

**It depends on the group.**

**Some groups say:**
- "No mind-altering substances" (includes psychedelics)
- "Keep it simple" (may not embrace blockchain)
- "Stick to the basics" (may not want innovation)

**We say:**
- Psychedelics can be used sacredly
- Technology can support spirituality
- Innovation honors tradition

**Our approach:**
- Respect all paths
- Offer an alternative
- Don't claim to replace AA/NA
- Complement, don't compete

### What about anonymity?

**Blockchain is pseudonymous:**
- Wallet addresses are public
- Transactions are visible
- But addresses aren't linked to real names

**For true anonymity:**
- Use Aleo privacy layer (future)
- Zero-knowledge proofs
- Anonymous voting
- Encrypted intentions

**Protect your privacy:**
- Don't doxx yourself
- Use separate wallet for recovery activities
- Be careful what you share publicly
