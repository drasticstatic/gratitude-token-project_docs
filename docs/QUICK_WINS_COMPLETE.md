# Quick Wins Implementation - 2025-10-14

## ‚úÖ Task 1: Add Global Heartbeat Animation
**File:** `src/index.css`
**Status:** COMPLETE ‚úÖ

Added global `@keyframes heartbeat` definition after line 1078:
```css
/* Global heartbeat animation - used across all pages */
@keyframes heartbeat {
  0%, 100% { transform: scale(1); }
  10% { transform: scale(1.1); }
  20% { transform: scale(1); }
  30% { transform: scale(1.1); }
  40% { transform: scale(1); }
}
```

**Result:** This fixes the inconsistent heartbeat animation on Daily Shrooms and Cross Breeding pages!

## üöß Task 2: Add FAQ Section to Swap Page
**File:** `src/components/pages/Swap.js`
**Status:** IN PROGRESS

**FAQ Content to Add:**

### What is PSD Token?
PSD (Psilocybin Sacrament Dollar) is the governance and utility token of Psanctuary Church's Ethereal Offering ecosystem. It represents your stake in the community and grants voting rights in the DAO.

### How Does the AMM Work?
Our Automated Market Maker (AMM) uses a constant product formula (x * y = k) to enable decentralized token swaps. Liquidity providers deposit equal values of both tokens to create a trading pool.

### What is Liquidity?
Liquidity refers to the pool of tokens available for trading. When you provide liquidity, you deposit both tokens into the pool and receive LP (Liquidity Provider) tokens representing your share.

### How Do I Provide Liquidity?
1. Connect your wallet
2. Click "Manage Liquidity"
3. Enter equal USD values of both tokens
4. Approve the transaction
5. Receive LP tokens representing your pool share

### What Are the Risks?
- **Impermanent Loss:** If token prices diverge, you may have less value than holding tokens separately
- **Smart Contract Risk:** Always DYOR and understand the code
- **Market Volatility:** Crypto prices can change rapidly

### Token Economics
- **Total Supply:** Fixed at deployment
- **Distribution:** Community-driven through DAO governance
- **Utility:** Governance voting, staking rewards, ceremonial burning
