# Proof of Burn (POB) NFTs

## 🔥 Overview

**Proof of Burn (POB) NFTs** are soulbound tokens that serve as permanent, immutable receipts of your ceremonial offerings at the Sacred Altar. Each POB is a unique piece of generative art that captures the essence of your burn.

---

## 🎨 What Makes POB NFTs Special?

### Soulbound Nature

POB NFTs are **soulbound** (non-transferable):

- ✅ **Cannot be sold** - No marketplace value
- ✅ **Cannot be transferred** - Stays in your wallet forever
- ✅ **Cannot be stolen** - Worthless to hackers
- ✅ **Permanent proof** - Immutable record of your offering

**Why soulbound?**
- Prevents commodification of spiritual practice
- Ensures authenticity (can't buy someone else's journey)
- Focuses on intrinsic value, not market value
- Honors the sacred nature of offerings

### Generative Artwork

Each POB features **unique generative art** created algorithmically:

**Art is influenced by:**
1. **Burn Amount** - Larger burns = more elaborate art
2. **Intention Hash** - Your encrypted intention affects colors
3. **Moon Phase** - New moon, full moon, etc. influence design
4. **Season** - Spring, summer, fall, winter themes
5. **Streak** - Longer streaks add special effects
6. **Rarity Tier** - Common to Legendary determines complexity

**Example:**
- Burn: 5,000 ETHO (Blaze tier)
- Moon: Full moon
- Season: Winter
- Streak: 90 days
- Result: Rare POB with silver/blue colors, moon motif, animated snowflakes

### Metadata

Each POB stores rich metadata:

## 🔗 Technical Details

### Smart Contract

POB NFTs are ERC-721 tokens:

```solidity
contract ProofOfBurn is ERC721, Ownable {
    // Soulbound: prevent transfers
    function _beforeTokenTransfer(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 tokenId
    ) internal override {
        require(
            from == address(0) || to == address(0),
            "POB: Soulbound token cannot be transferred"
        );
        super._beforeTokenTransfer(from, to, tokenId);
    }
    
    // Mint POB when offering is made
    function mint(
        address recipient,
        uint256 burnAmount,
        bytes32 intentionHash,
        uint256 mdaoEarned
    ) external onlyAltar returns (uint256) {
        uint256 tokenId = _nextTokenId++;
        
        // Store metadata
        _burnAmounts[tokenId] = burnAmount;
        _intentions[tokenId] = intentionHash;
        _mdaoEarned[tokenId] = mdaoEarned;
        _timestamps[tokenId] = block.timestamp;
        
        // Mint NFT
        _safeMint(recipient, tokenId);
        
        return tokenId;
    }
}
```

### Metadata Storage

**On-chain:**
- Burn amount
- Timestamp
- Intention hash
- MDAO earned

**IPFS:**
- Artwork image
- Full metadata JSON
- Decentralized storage
- Permanent availability

### Art Generation

POB art is generated **on-demand**:

1. User makes offering
2. Smart contract emits event
3. Backend service listens
4. Generates art based on parameters
5. Uploads to IPFS
6. Updates token metadata

**Deterministic:** Same inputs = same art (reproducible)

## 💡 Philosophy

### Why Soulbound?

**Traditional NFTs** can be bought and sold:
- Commodifies spiritual practice
- Enables fraud (buy someone else's journey)
- Focuses on market value
- Misses the point

**Soulbound POBs** are personal:
- Cannot be commodified
- Authentic proof of YOUR journey
- Intrinsic value only
- Honors the sacred

### The Burnt Offering Tradition

POB NFTs are inspired by ancient practices:

**Biblical Burnt Offerings:**
- Material goods offered to God
- Consumed by fire
- Act of worship and surrender
- Atonement and gratitude

**Hindu Yajna:**
- Fire ceremony
- Offerings to deities
- Purification and transformation
- Sacred ritual

**Buddhist Incense Offerings:**
- Burning incense
- Offering to Buddha
- Mindfulness practice
- Letting go

**POB NFTs digitize this ancient wisdom:**
- Burn tokens (digital offering)
- Permanent record (blockchain)
- Spiritual practice (intention)
- Community witness (transparency)
