## üöß IN PROGRESS - READY TO IMPLEMENT

### Task: Fix Heartbeat Animation
**File:** `src/index.css`
**Action:** Add global `@keyframes heartbeat` definition after line 1078

**Code to add:**
```css
/* Global heartbeat animation - used across all pages */
@keyframes heartbeat {
  0%, 100% { transform: scale(1); }
  10% { transform: scale(1.1); }
  20% { transform: scale(1); }
  30% { transform: scale(1.1); }
  40% { transform: scale(1); }
}
```

**Status:** Ready to implement - just need your approval

---

### Task: Add FAQ Section to Swap Page
**File:** `src/components/pages/Swap.js`
**Current:** Has PageInfo component but no FAQ section
**Action:** Add tokenomics FAQ section explaining:
- What is PSD token?
- How does the AMM work?
- What is liquidity?
- How do I provide liquidity?
- What are the risks?
- Token economics and mechanics

**Status:** Ready to implement - need to determine placement (before or after swap interface?)

---

### Task: Add Constitution Section to Contact Page
**File:** `src/components/pages/Contact.js`
**Current:** Has expandedConstitution state variable (line 23) but no content
**Action:** Add Preamble and Article I Section 3 (Religious Freedom)

**Content to add:**
```
PREAMBLE
We, the members of Psanctuary Church, united in our commitment to spiritual exploration, 
personal sovereignty, and the sacred use of entheogenic sacraments, do hereby establish 
this Constitution to protect our religious freedoms and guide our community.

ARTICLE I - RELIGIOUS FREEDOM
Section 3: Sacramental Rights
The use of psilocybin mushrooms and other natural entheogens as sacraments is a 
fundamental religious practice of Psanctuary Church, protected under the First Amendment 
and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA).
```

**Status:** Ready to implement - need to determine styling and placement

## üìã AWAITING DETAILED FEEDBACK

### Task: Enhanced 404 Page (Round 2)
**Your Feedback:**
- ‚úÖ Darker background - DONE
- ‚ùå Mycelial road connecting elements - NOT YET
- ‚ùå Lighthouse effect for "light shining through" - NOT YET
- ‚ùå 404 SVG border should fade into background - NOT YET
- ‚ùå Sparkles should float around with more colors - PARTIAL
- ‚ùå Mushrooms should match current title SVGs (skinnier/taller, custom colors, waving) - NOT YET
- ‚ùå Everything should breathe with heartbeat simultaneously - NOT YET
- ‚ùå Use existing Psanctuary watermark (not new text) - NOT YET
- ‚ùå Include existing scattered blockchain boxes from other pages - NOT YET
- ‚úÖ Keep new blockchain cubes as additional glitter (smaller) - DONE

**This is a complex task that requires:**
1. Importing PsanctuaryWatermark component
2. Importing ScatteredBlockchainCubes component
3. Creating custom mushroom SVGs matching title icons
4. Creating mycelial network connections
5. Creating lighthouse effect
6. Synchronizing all animations to heartbeat

**Recommendation:** I should create this as a completely new 404.html file with all React components, or keep it as standalone HTML with inline SVGs?

---

### Task: Favicon Updates
**Your Answers:**
1. **Main dApp:** Static EO.png with similar animation as nav-logo
   - **Question:** Favicons in browser tabs don't animate with CSS. Do you want:
     - A) Just use EO.png as static favicon (no animation possible in tab)
     - B) Create animated SVG that looks like EO.png (may not animate in all browsers)
     - C) Keep current setup

2. **Docusaurus:** Confirmed - current SVG but more psychedelic
   - Fix continuous 360¬∞ rotation ‚úÖ
   - Add breathing letters ‚úÖ
   - Add color-changing (background slowest, sparkles fastest) ‚úÖ

**Status:** Awaiting clarification on main dApp favicon approach

---

### Task: Replace Homepage Icons & Add Navigation
**Your Answers:**
1. **Replace static icons:** Use WhitepaperScrollIcon and SpiritualFoundationIcon ‚úÖ
2. **Top-right navigation:** Create NEW simpler icons that resemble current ones ‚úÖ
3. **Section titles:** "‚ú® What is Ethereal Offering" / "üîÆ Meet the Oracle of Fruit" ‚úÖ
4. **Make titles clickable:** Format to show they're expandable ‚úÖ

**Status:** Ready to implement! Just need to create the simpler icon versions.

**Question:** For the simpler top-right icons, should they be:
- Simplified SVG versions (just outlines, no animations)?
- Smaller versions of the full animated icons?
- Completely different minimal style?

---

## üéØ RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

### Immediate Quick Wins (Can do right now):
1. ‚úÖ Add global heartbeat animation to src/index.css
2. ‚úÖ Add FAQ section to Swap page
3. ‚úÖ Add Constitution section to Contact page
4. ‚úÖ Update section titles on homepage
5. ‚úÖ Replace static icons with animated ones on homepage

### Requires More Design Work:
1. ‚ùì Enhanced 404 page (complex - needs mycelial network, lighthouse, custom mushrooms)
2. ‚ùì Favicon strategy (need clarification on browser limitations)
3. ‚ùì Top-right navigation icons (need to design simpler versions)

---

## üí° PROPOSAL

**Let me proceed with the 5 quick wins above while you:**
1. Review the 404 page requirements (it's complex - might need to be a React component)
2. Decide on favicon approach (browser tabs don't animate CSS)
3. Provide feedback on simpler icon style for top-right navigation

**This way we make immediate progress on clear tasks while refining the complex ones!**

**Say "proceed with quick wins" and I'll implement items 1-5 immediately!**
