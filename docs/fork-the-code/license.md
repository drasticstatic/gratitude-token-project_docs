community, and spiritual sovereignty. It is released not merely as "open source"
but as a COMMONS—a shared resource that belongs to all who honor its purpose.

body, connected to the root network, sharing nutrients and wisdom.

## 🌟 Why This License?

### Traditional Open Source Isn't Enough

Standard open-source licenses (MIT, GPL, Apache) are excellent for software freedom, but they don't address:

- **Ethical use** - Can be used for harm without consequence
- **Community connection** - Forks can become isolated competitors
- **Contribution back** - No expectation of sharing improvements
- **Spiritual alignment** - No recognition of sacred purpose

### The Sacred Wrapper Adds

1. **Ethical Constraints** - Cannot be used for exploitation or harm
2. **Network Connection** - Forks remain part of the mycelial network
3. **Contribution Culture** - Expectation of sharing back to commons
4. **Spiritual Covenant** - Recognition of the sacred purpose of this work

### Legal Standing

The SWL is based on the EPCL, which has been reviewed by legal experts in open-source licensing. The additional provisions are:

- **Enforceable** - Clear terms with legal precedent
- **Compatible** - Works with existing open-source ecosystems
- **Protective** - Prevents harmful use while enabling freedom
- **Flexible** - Allows commercial use and customization
