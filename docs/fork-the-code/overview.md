# Fork the Code: Expanding the Mycelial Network

> *"The mycelium grows not by division, but by expansion. Each new fruiting body remains connected to the root network, sharing nutrients, wisdom, and life force."*

---

## üåø A Sacred Invitation

Welcome to **Fork the Code**‚Äîa comprehensive guide for churches, fellowships, recovery communities, and policy reform groups who wish to adopt and adapt the Ethereal Offering framework for their own governance, fundraising, and community-building efforts.

This is not a typical open-source fork. This is a **sacred covenant**‚Äîa way of sharing technology that honors both **individual sovereignty** and **collective unity**.

## üî• The Vision: One Mycelium, Many Fruiting Bodies

Imagine a world where:

- **Every church** has transparent, DAO-based governance
- **Every recovery fellowship** can issue soulbound tokens for sobriety milestones
- **Every policy reform group** has blockchain-verified fundraising
- **Every spiritual community** can create sacred ceremonies on-chain

And yet, all of these separate communities remain **connected**‚Äîsharing innovations, supporting each other, and contributing back to the collective wisdom.

This is the **mycelial network model**: 

- **The Root Network** = The core Ethereal Offering protocol and shared infrastructure
- **Fruiting Bodies** = Individual churches, fellowships, and organizations running their own instances
- **Mycelial Threads** = Shared governance standards, interoperable tokens, cross-community support

## üèõÔ∏è Who Should Fork This Code?

### Churches & Spiritual Communities
- Seeking transparent financial stewardship
- Wanting democratic governance while honoring elder wisdom
- Exploring blockchain for tithes, offerings, and sacred ceremonies
- Building digital sanctuaries for their congregations

## üåä The Sacred Covenant: Fork to Expand, Never to Separate

### Core Principles

When you fork this code, you agree to:

#### 1. **Expansion, Not Division**
Your fork is not a competitor‚Äîit's an **extension** of the mycelial network. You're adding a new fruiting body, not splitting the organism.

#### 2. **Non-Claim of Authority**
You do not claim to be "the original" or "the official" Ethereal Offering. You are a **sovereign instance** connected to the shared root.

#### 3. **Contribution Back to the Commons**
Innovations, improvements, and lessons learned are **shared back** with the root network and other forks.

#### 4. **Interoperability Commitment**
Your instance maintains **technical compatibility** with the core protocol, enabling cross-community features.

#### 5. **No Patents, No Enclosure**
You cannot patent, privatize, or enclose any part of the shared codebase. The commons remain commons.

### The Sacred Wrapper License
