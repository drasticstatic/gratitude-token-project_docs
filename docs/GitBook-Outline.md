*A Spiritual Hash Rate Protocol for Decentralized Recovery, Gratitude, Governance, and Policy Reform*

---

### Tagline:  
**Mining Grace. Minting Gratitude. Upholding Each Other in Light.**

---

## Preface – “The Author Is the Collective”  
The words here belong to no single voice.  
They emerge from Christ-consciousness — the living network of Love that transcends the ego’s illusion of separation.  

- **Proof of Work**: The refinement of soul through honest living.  
- **Proof of Stake**: The willingness to invest faith, humility, and service in the Kingdom within.  

---

## Chapter 1 – The Vision: From Sobriety to Spiritual Hashrate  

The fellowship is a living blockchain of hearts, where each member’s effort, humility, and gratitude increase the collective’s “spiritual hashrate.”  

- **Proof of Work**: Personal spiritual effort — inventory, confession, forgiveness.  
- **Proof of Stake**: Investment in service and community.  
- **Mining**: Not for profit, but for presence.  
- **Hashrate**: The intensity of sincerity in one’s devotion to truth and healing.

## Chapter 2 – The Mycelial Network Beneath the Steps  

- **Metaphor**: Like mycelium, each node (member) transmits nourishment across hidden roots.  
- **Structure**: Decentralized, resilient, regenerative.  
- **Lesson**: Anonymity is not absence — it’s communion beneath the surface.

## Chapter 3 – The Twelve Steps as a Decentralized Protocol  

Each Step is a spiritual smart contract:  

1. **Admit our powerlessness** — Genesis block of honesty.  
2. **Believe in a greater Power** — Public key of faith.  
3. **Surrender** — Delegated consensus.  
4. **Moral inventory** — Ledger audit.  
5. **Confession** — On-chain proof of truth.  
6–7. **Humility and readiness** — Protocol upgrade.  
8–9. **Amends** — Restoration transactions.  
10–12. **Practice, prayer, and service** — Continuous mining.

## Chapter 4 – NFT Chips: Proof of Presence  

- **Name**: Soulbound Fellowship Chips  
- **Purpose**: Replace physical sobriety tokens with NFT chips.  
- **Type**: Non-transferable, Soulbound NFTs (SBTs).  

### Meaning:  
- Each NFT marks a milestone (attendance, commitment, or gratitude offering).  
- Each is visually animated — inspired by TON stickers and albums.  
- Future integration with Telegram gift mechanics and Aleo privacy proofs.  

### Symbolism:  
- Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Crystal grades — representing stages of awakening.  
- Inscribed with “Proof of Presence” on the metadata layer.

## Chapter 5 – Governance: The Fellowship DAO  

**Psychedelics in Recovery DAO**  

### Core Values:  
- Transparency through truth.  
- Privacy through grace.  
- Leadership through shared humility.  

### Mechanics:  
- DAO votes trigger MPC key rotation for secure recovery governance.  
- DAO treasury supports policy reform, education, and mutual aid.  
- Weighted voting possible through earned spiritual hashrate, not token wealth.

## Chapter 6 – Tokenomics: Gratitude Mining  

**Ethereal Offering Token (EOT)** integrates with:  

- **Gratitude Mining**: Spiritual effort equals contribution.  
- **Rewards**: Symbolic participation NFTs, redeemable for DAO input.  
- **Economics**: Aligned with Aleo staking model — value flows through contribution, not speculation.  
- **Proof of Yield**: Peace, service, and relational integrity.  

---

## Chapter 7 – Aleo Integration: Zero-Knowledge Policy Reform  

- **ZK-enabled anonymous voting** for policy proposals in psychedelic reform.  
- **Recovery of governance keys** through community vote (MPC + DAO).  
- **Private confessions**: ZK-proofs enable verifiable accountability without exposure.  
- **Compliance**: Aligns with holistic, trauma-informed reform movements.

## Chapter 8 – Gratitude Ledger  

A living record of collective miracles, testimonies, and recovery.  

- Each entry becomes a non-fungible prayer — timestamped proof of transformation.
