Welcome. This Sync Pack is a comprehensive, public-facing portal you can use from any computer to understand, present, and extend the Ethereal Offering front-end and docs.

Use this section to navigate fast during limited computer time. Each page is concise at a glance and deep when you need it.

What’s inside:

- Front-End Overview and File Structure
- Development Setup and Commands
- State and Data Flow (Wallet → UI → Contracts)
- Styling and Theming Guide
- Web3 Integration (wallets, networks, safety)
- Component Catalog: Pages, Modals, Effects, Icons, Wallet/Treasury
- Publishing and Access (GitHub Pages, URLs, troubleshooting)

Quick links:

- Front-End Overview: ./frontend/overview
- Dev Setup: ./frontend/dev-setup
- Web3 Integration: ./frontend/web3-integration
- Component Catalog: ./frontend/components/pages
- Publishing & Access: ./deploy/gh-pages

Vision note: As the Eternal Fire purifies and structures, we build interfaces that reveal sacred order in motion—one mycelium, many fruiting bodies; fork to expand, never to separate.
