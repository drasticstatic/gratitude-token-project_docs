title: Effects (Ambient Motion)
description: Subtle visual layers that support, not distract, the ceremony of interaction.
---

Location: docs/src/components/effects/

Highlights:

- AnimatedMushroomCursor.js — playful cursor effect
- CursorTrail.js — path-aware trail for motion delight
- MistRainEffect.js — ambient depth and mystery
- Sparkles.js — micro-glitter for sacred emphasis
- SporeEffect.js — themed particle effect
- TransactionSporeEffect.js — tx feedback via spores

Usage notes:

- Use sparingly; the effect should never obscure intent
- Defer heavy effects behind user interaction to save resources
- Respect “reduce motion” preferences when feasible
