## 🙏 A Note from the Creator

This work was born from a journey through loss, forgiveness, and remembrance. It represents not just a technological platform, but a living prayer — that generosity might become governance, that transparency might restore trust, and that every offering might help restore the world.

May this content serve you well in your own journey of discovery and healing.
