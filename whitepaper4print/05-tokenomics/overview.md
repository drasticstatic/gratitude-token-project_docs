# Tokenomics Overview

For detailed tokenomics information, please see:

## Main Whitepaper Section
- **../03-whitepaper/05-tokenomics.md** - Complete tokenomics design and economics

## Research & Analysis
- **../08-research/tokenomics-analysis.md** - Deep dive into tokenomics design decisions
- **../08-research/treasury-flow.md** - Treasury mechanics and flow patterns

## Key Concepts

### Token Types

1. **Gratitude Token (GRAT)**
   - Soulbound recognition for service and contribution
   - Non-transferable, earned through meaningful participation
   - Represents authentic engagement in the ecosystem

2. **Governance Token**
   - Enables anonymous, verifiable voting through zero-knowledge proofs
   - Powers DAO decision-making
   - Distributed based on participation and service

3. **Treasury Flows**
   - Transparent, on-chain tracking of all funds
   - Community-governed allocation
   - Directed toward social causes and healing initiatives

### Economic Principles

- **Regenerative Economics** - Value flows in cycles, not lines
- **Service-Based Rewards** - Honor contribution over speculation
- **Transparent Treasury** - All movements visible on-chain
- **Community Governance** - Collective decisions on resource allocation

### Treasury Mechanics

The treasury functions as a living organism:
- **Strategic Reserve** - Maintains ecosystem stability
- **Active Stewardship** - Engages in external arbitrage for regeneration
- **Community-Driven** - All allocations governed by DAO votes
- **Transparent Flows** - Every transaction visible and verifiable
