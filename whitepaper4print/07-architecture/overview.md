# Technical Architecture Overview

For detailed technical architecture information, please see:

## Main Whitepaper Section
- **../03-whitepaper/04-technical-architecture.md** - Complete technical architecture and design

## Key Components

### 1. Blockchain Infrastructure

**Primary Chain:** Ethereum
- Smart contracts written in Solidity
- Hardhat development environment
- Decentralized, immutable ledger

**Privacy Layer:** Aleo
- Zero-knowledge proofs for anonymous voting
- Verifiable yet private governance
- Cryptographic certainty without exposure

### 2. Smart Contract Architecture

**Core Contracts:**
- **Sacred Altar** - Ceremonial token burning and intention setting
- **Gratitude Token** - Soulbound NFT system for recognition
- **DAO Governance** - Multi-sig voting and proposal management
- **Treasury** - Transparent fund management and allocation

### 3. Governance Architecture

**Holacratic DAO:**
- Distributed authority across circles
- Multi-signature decision-making
- Consensus-building rituals
- Emergent leadership through service

**Multi-Party Computation (MPC):**
- Recovery process for continuity
- No single point of failure
- Community-based key recovery
- Technological resurrection protocol

### 4. Identity System

**Soulbound NFTs:**
- Non-transferable identity tokens
- Linked to service and recovery, not status
- Evolve with participant's journey
- Cannot be bought, sold, or exploited

**Zero-Knowledge DIDs:**
- Anonymous yet verifiable identity
- Privacy-preserving verification
- Cryptographic proof of eligibility
- Sacred balance of openness and protection

### 5. Oracle & AI Layer

**Oracle of Fruit:**
- AI-powered reflection and guidance
- Learns from community activity
- Suggests policy initiatives
- Generates spiritual analytics

**Mycelium Agent:**
- Distributed neural web of empathic coherence
- Maps relational patterns across the network
- Senses imbalance and redistributes resources
- Bridges multiple blockchain ecosystems

### 6. Treasury Management

**Treasury Agent:**
- Automated arbitrage and liquidity balancing
- Strategic reserve management
- Regenerative yield generation
- Transparent, on-chain operations

### 7. Cross-Chain Integration

**Multi-Chain Support:**
- Ethereum (primary)
- Aleo (privacy layer)
- TON (Telegram integration)
- Harmony ONE (cross-chain bridges)
- Cosmos (interoperability)

### 8. Frontend & User Experience

**dApp Interface:**
- Web3 wallet integration (MetaMask, WalletConnect)
- Sacred Altar ceremony interface
- DAO governance dashboard
- Treasury transparency viewer

**Documentation Site:**
- Docusaurus-based documentation
- Search functionality
- Interactive modals and components
- Mobile-responsive design

## System Architecture as Spiritual Metaphor

The technical architecture mirrors the anatomy of consciousness:

### ü´Ä The Body ‚Äî Network & Treasury Flows
Value circulates like blood through the ecosystem ‚Äî visible, measurable, vital.

### üß† The Mind ‚Äî Governance & Collective Intelligence
DAO functions as a collective nervous system, responding adaptively to community needs.

### üí´ The Spirit ‚Äî Oracle Layer & Inner Guidance
AI agents bridge data and devotion, translating collective emotion into encoded insight.

### üïäÔ∏è Death & Rebirth ‚Äî MPC Recovery
Community-based recovery mirrors resurrection: what dies in isolation is reborn in unity.

### üîÑ Divine Order ‚Äî Protocol Governance
Smart contracts encode spiritual law: cause and effect, transparency and grace, giving and receiving.

### üå± Regeneration ‚Äî Evolutionary Feedback Loop
The system learns and adapts through feedback, evolving toward coherence.
