## ⚠ FIRST: sync this clone before you touch anything

```sh
git pull --rebase --autostash
```

Run this at the **start of every session**, before reading deeply or editing. Several agents and
Christopher push to these repos — including Cosmos agents that run unattended while nobody is at the
machine — so a clone can be behind by the time you open it.

**`--autostash` is what makes this safe on a dirty tree.** It stashes uncommitted changes, rebases
onto the remote, then reapplies them. Your in-progress work survives. Without it, `git pull --rebase`
refuses to run and you are tempted into something worse.

Why it matters more than it sounds:

- A stale clone **does not fail early.** It fails at push time, after the work is done, as a
  non-fast-forward rejection — the most expensive moment to discover it.
- The tempting fix at that point is `git push --force`, which discards whatever someone else pushed
  in the meantime. Syncing first removes the temptation.
- If a rebase does conflict, stop and resolve it deliberately. A conflict is information: someone
  else changed the same lines, and you want to know that *before* building on top of them.

**Fresh clone?** Also run `sh scripts/install-hooks.sh` — git hooks are not version-controlled, so
the commit-attribution hook stays inert until this clone is pointed at `.githooks/`. Details:
[`scripts/README.md`](./scripts/README.md).

## Project Overview

**gratitude-token-project_docs** is the interactive white-paper documentation site for the Gratitude Token / Church DAO governance treasury protocol. Built with Docusaurus and hosted on GitHub Pages.

**Live:** https://drasticstatic.github.io/gratitude-token-project_docs/
**Visibility:** PUBLIC — all content committed here is publicly visible
**Primary builder:** Auggie (Augment CLI)

---

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Framework | Docusaurus v3 |
| Language | React, MDX, TypeScript |
| Package manager | npm |
| Hosting | GitHub Pages |
| Node version | Node.js 18+ |

---

## Common Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start local dev server
npm start

# Build for production
npm run build

# Deploy to GitHub Pages (if configured)
npm run deploy
```

---

## Coding Standards

- Docusaurus conventions for sidebar config, frontmatter, and MDX components
- Docs in `docs/` — keep filenames kebab-case
- All images optimized before committing (`pngquant` or similar)
- No internal/private information in any committed file

---

## Agent Boundaries

**Do:**
- Follow Docusaurus structure strictly
- Keep content appropriate for public view at all times
- Ask before creating new doc categories or restructuring the sidebar

**Don't:**
- Include private wallet addresses, API keys, or internal team references
- Commit build artifacts (`.docusaurus/`, `build/` are gitignored)
- Add npm packages without flagging to Christopher first

---

## Security Rules

- **PUBLIC repo:** Every committed file is publicly visible — no private information whatsoever
- Never read, display, or commit `.env` files, private keys, or credential files
- Before adding any dependency: audit install hooks and verify provenance

---

## Override System

Create `AGENTS.override.md` for temporary task-specific rules. Delete when done. Template: `~/code/my-template/AGENTS.override.md`

## Commit attribution (enforced by hook)

Every commit must carry two git trailers:

```
Co-Authored-By: <Agent> · <Engine> · <Provider> [<Model>]                  # direct
Co-Authored-By: <Agent> · <Engine> · <Gateway> · <Provider> [<Model>]      # proxied
<Platform>-Session: <full session URL>
```

Model in **square brackets**, separator is U+00B7 MIDDLE DOT ( · ). Add `<Gateway>` **only when
inference is proxied** — it names what *routed* the request (`NVIDIA NIM`, `OpenRouter`), never who
made the model (`Z.ai`, `Moonshot AI`, `MiniMaxAI`). The field order mirrors the `/model` selector
string, so `anthropic/nvidia_nim/z-ai/glm4.7` transcribes to `NVIDIA NIM · Z.ai [GLM-4.7]` —
read it left to right rather than memorising it. Local runtimes (`Ollama`, `llama.cpp`,
`LM Studio`) have no gateway: the weights ran on your machine, so the runtime is the Provider. The session
trailer is a **separate** line — folding it onto the `Co-Authored-By:` line breaks git trailer
parsing. Use the full session URL, never a truncated prefix. Key varies by platform:
`Claude-Session:` for Claude Code CLI, `Cosmos-Session:` for Cosmos.

`.githooks/commit-msg` rejects non-conforming commits. **Activate it once per clone:**

```sh
sh scripts/install-hooks.sh
```

Human-only commits: `git commit --no-verify`. **Canonical spec — single source of truth. Do not restate the field table locally; link it:**
